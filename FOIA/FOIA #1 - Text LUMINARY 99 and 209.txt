My request is for two Apollo Guidance Computer software listings:

    LUMINARY 99     ("REVISION 099 OF AGC PROGRAM LUMINARY BY NASA 2021112-051")
    LUMINARY 209    

Individually, these are each about 1750 pages of 11"x14" fanfold paper, approximately 
2" thick.  It's possible that (wherever they are) they may be misindentified as
Apollo Lunar Module software for Apollo 11 and Apollo 17.  For visual identification
purposes, very-similar digitized versions of the true Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 software
(namely LUMINARY 99 rev 1 and LUMINARY 210) can be seen at the following links:

Background information which may be helpful in terms of searching for this material:  
In May 2005, former Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) developer Allan Klumpp (MIT 
Instrumentation Laboratory) submitted two listings of AGC software source code to 
then-NASA-employee Richard B. Katz of the NASA Office of Logic Design.  Allan Klumpp 
told me that this was on the understanding that these two program listings would be 
digitized and made available online at the Office of Logic Design website (klabs.org).
The promised digitization and online-posting never occurred.

I have no current contact information for Richard B. Katz.
