This is a fee waiver request associated with FOIA search for Apollo Guidance
Computer software designated "LUMINARY 99" and "LUMINARY 210".

The reasons for the fee-waiver request are as follows:

1.  The intended use of the sought materials is to present it publicly as part
    of a sequence of other Apollo Guidance Computer software versions, from the
    beginning of the Apollo program until the end.  The purpose is entirely
    to illustrate the process of carrying out a U.S. Government 
    software-development project such as Apollo.
2.  The material is provided online, free of charge, and without advertisement.
    In other words, there is no commercial interest whatever.
3.  Though not affiliated with any recognized educational institution, this
    activity may be viewed both as journalistic and as educational in nature.

Additionally, I would like to point out that the material sought was presented
by its owner to a then-NASA-employee (in 2005, to Richard B. Katz of the NASA
Office of Logic Design) with the understanding that it would be digitized and
provided online at the Office of Logic Design website (klabs.org).  The 
promised results did not ensue.  Since we are only trying to recover the 
materials due to failure of this promise, it is unfair to require payment for
it.
