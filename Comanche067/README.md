The Comanche067/ folder contains the attempt at reconstructing Comanche 67 source code (Apollo 12 CM), working from the baseline of Comanche 55, with reference to previously-reconstructed Artemis 71 source code and the available contemporary documentation.

The reconstruction is currently incomplete. In fact, there are overflowing memory banks, so it won't even assemble without errors.

The reconstruction effort *had been* covered in detail in issue #1140 (https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1140), but the narrative eventually became too unwieldy in the context of a GitHub issue so I am currently documenting it on a separate wiki page (https://slimwiki.com/virtual-agc-project/comanche-67-reconstruction).  

Also, during this reconstruction process, you cannot hope to successfully edit or build the reconstructed code without consulting the crucial documentation near the beginning of the [Makefile](https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/comanche67/Comanche067/Makefile).

**Note:**  I currently (2022-10-05) regard this reconstruction attempt as terminated.  Though very good progress was made, I think, there simply is not enough paper trail of the changes from Comanche 55 to Comanche 67 to complete the work.  The comanche67 branch will be retained, but not merged into the main branch. There will probably be no additional changes to this branch, even if additional relevant information becomes available.
