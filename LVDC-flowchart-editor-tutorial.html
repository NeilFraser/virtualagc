    <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
    <p>If you're reading this, I assume you know what the <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="LVDC.html">LVDC</a> was, know what
      the flight software for it is, and that you have access to the
      available LVDC flight-program source code in compliance with
      whatever ITAR restrictions on export of that software from the
      U.S. may or may not be, so I won't rehash that territory here.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Rather, this page is solely about the creation and maintenance of
      software flowcharts based LVDC flight-program software.&nbsp; By
      that, I <i>do not</i> mean creation of flowcharts that allow
      complete and accurate recreation of the flight-program
      software.&nbsp; Instead, I refer to a set of undocumented
      annotations that appear in AS-512 and AS-513 flight-program
      software (and presumably other versions of the flight software not
      available to us) that I theorize <i>may</i> have been hints for
      draftsmen creating mid-level flowcharts that could provide
      convenient guidance to someone trying to understand the general
      flow of the software.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In fact, this is entirely my own idea:&nbsp; There is no
      available evidence at all about who created the annotations I
      refer to, when they were created, why they were created, whether
      they actually relate to flowcharting, how to interpret the
      annotations, nor whether flowcharts created from them provide a
      reasonably-accurate view of the software flow that could be useful
      to someone or not.&nbsp; I merely observe that flowcharts <i>can</i>
      be created based on these annotations, that those flowcharts are
      pleasing to <i>me</i>, and that perhaps that they are not
      entirely without merit more generally.<br>
    </p>
    <p>But they are not perfect.&nbsp; The two main problems about the
      flowcharts that bother me are:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The LVDC software's flowchart-related annotations — if that's
        what they are! — are neither fully complete nor fully
        correct.&nbsp; Therefore, manual corrections to the annotations
        are sometimes useful in producing more-informative flowcharts.<br>
      </li>
      <li>We don't know if the flowcharts we produce are actually good
        reflections of the software source code or not.&nbsp; Perhaps
        they're misleading!&nbsp; They need to be checked and corrected
        if they do turn out to mislead.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Potentially, the latter of these problems may ultimately require
      updates to the flowchart-generation software (more about that in a
      moment)&nbsp; But regardless, the first step for either of the
      problems is human inspection of the flowcharts and of their
      relationship to the LVDC source code, along with manual editing of
      the flowcharting annotations as necessary.&nbsp; Both are
      difficult tasks, but are the kinds of tasks that can be rewarding
      in terms of the understanding gained of the LVDC software in the
      process.&nbsp; This tutorial is addressed to someone who would
      want to involve themself in process of checking and improving the
      LVDC flowcharts.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h2>
    You will need to have access to the transcribed LVDC source code for
    whatever software version(s) you're working with.&nbsp; I hope that
    eventually this source code can be made generally available, but as
    of this writing it is being treated as if it is restricted from U.S.
    export by ITAR.&nbsp; If you are qualified to do so, for example by
    being a U.S. citizen, follow whatever instructions are given on <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="LVDC.html">the LVDC web page</a> for
    obtaining access.&nbsp; <i>If</i> the source code is truly
    restricted by ITAR, legally rather than by some whim of a
    functionary who doesn't care to look into the matter, and if it
    continues to be so-restricted, realize that if you do "export" it by
    giving it to a non-qualified individual or by posting it online, it
    is you have violated ITAR and you who will be legally responsible
    for those actions.<br>
    <p>As far as the flowcharts themselves are concerned, you don't
      actually need copies of them since you'll have the capability of
      building them yourself.&nbsp; With that said ....&nbsp; Unlike the
      LVDC source code, I do not believe that the flowcharts are
      restricted by ITAR, and so it's possible you may find them on the
      LVDC web page.&nbsp; However, at least at first, I am continuing
      to treat them as ITAR-restricted, so it may be that the only place
      you'll find them is the same place you got the LVDC source code.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Having downloaded the LVDC source code and (optionally) the
      flowcharts onto your computer, you'll have encrypted archives in
      the 7z format, respectively LVDC-software.git.7z and (optionally)
      dots.7z.&nbsp; You'll need 7z-enabled archiving software to unpack
      these archives.&nbsp; Google it to find out what the right
      archiving software is for you platform.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The unpacked LVDC software is in the form of a git repository, so
      to access it you'll need to have git installed on your
      computer.&nbsp; The unpacked git repository will be called
      LVDC-software.git, and won't appear to have any usable files in
      it.&nbsp; You'll need to run the command<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>git clone LVDC-software.git<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>thus creating a new folder (called just LVDC-software) in which
      you'll be able to find all of the LVDC source-code files.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer in
      order to run the flowchart-generation software.&nbsp; I don't
      believe that any nonstandard Python modules need to be separately
      installed.&nbsp; Python 2 will <i>not</i> suffice.<br>
    </p>
    <p><a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaASM.py">My



        flowchart-generation software needs to be downloaded</a>.&nbsp;
      The only files actually needed are yaASMflowchart2.py and
      sdl.ps.&nbsp; No installation is needed, though you may find it
      helpful to give yaASMflowchart2.py "executable" permissions (if
      that's something that exists in your operating system) and to put
      it in your PATH.&nbsp; The easiest thing to do with sdl.ps is to
      put it directly in whatever folders hold LVDC source-code files
      (*.lvdc).<br>
    </p>
    <p>The graph-visualization software <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://graphviz.org/download/">graphviz</a> is
      needed.&nbsp; This is a free download (Linux/Windows/Mac).<br>
    </p>
    <p>(Optional.)&nbsp; In viewing or editing LVDC source code, it is
      helpful though not required for the viewing/editing software to be
      able to provide syntax highlighting for LVDC assembly
      language.&nbsp; You'll see examples of that below.&nbsp; The only
      editor presently having LVDC syntax-highlighting capability is <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a>,
      which is admittedly not to everyone's taste.<br>
    </p>
    <table border="1" align="center" width="95%" cellspacing="2"
      cellpadding="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; If you do
              choose to install vim, LVDC syntax highlighting is not a
              standard feature and must be installed separately as a
              one-time setup.&nbsp; To do so, <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                href="lvdc_vim.zip">download this zipfile</a> and
              uncompress it.&nbsp; In the uncompressed folder you'll
              find two other folders, named "ftdetect" and
              "syntax".&nbsp; There's some folder on your system that
              holds vim syntax-highlighting options, though
              unfortunately I don't know what it is and you'll have to
              google it to find out.&nbsp; On my own Linux system, that
              folder happens to be ~/.vim/, though it didn't exist at
              first and I had to create it myself.&nbsp; At any rate,
              once you figure out the folder you're supposed to use,
              and/or you create it, then you should copy ftdetect and
              syntax into it.&nbsp; From now on, whenever you open an
              LVDC source-code file with vim, it will be
              syntax-highlighted.</font> </td>

    <p> </p>
    <p>(Optional.)&nbsp; The flowcharts are produced in PostScript
      format.&nbsp; To view them, you either need document-viewer
      software that supports PostScript, or else graphics software that
      can conveniently convert PostScript to some other image format,
      preferably PNG.&nbsp; There are so many possibilities on so many
      different platforms (Linux vs Windows vs Mac) that it is hard to
      make solid recommendations.&nbsp; With that said, I most-often use
      <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick

        graphics software</a> when converting to PNG, and instructions I
      give will be geared towards it.&nbsp; Personally, I seldom have
      reason to perform such conversions.<br>

          <td valign="top"><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; At this
              writing, ImageMagick 6 and ImageMagick 7 are both
              generally available, with ImageMagick 6 being the
              most-readily available on my computer system.&nbsp; At
              least on my computer (Linux Mint 21), ImageMagick 6 is
              constrained by various "policy" settings, and (for me) the
              default policy settings were heavily weighted against my
              being able to actually perform flowchart
              conversions.&nbsp; So before doing anything at all, I
              needed to change the policy settings.&nbsp; I don't know
              if ImageMagick 7 has equivalent policy problems. Perhaps
              not.&nbsp; I didn't need to change any myself.</font><br>
            <br>
            <font size="-1">ImageMagick 6 policy settings are found in a
              file called policy.xml stored <i>somewhere</i> on your
              computer.&nbsp; (On my system, they're at
              /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml.)&nbsp; The file may require
              administrative rights to edit.&nbsp; Fortunately, these
              policy changes are a one-time-only thing, and once set
              they can be forgotten.&nbsp; On my system, the default
              policy settings disallowed all operations using
              ghostscript, thus disallowing operations on PostScript
              files, so I had to comment out the policy reading</font><br>
            <blockquote><font size="-1"><tt>&lt;policy domain="coder"
                  rights="none" pattern="PS" /&gt;</tt></font><br>
            </blockquote>
            <font size="-1">Then too, there are various policies
              representing limits on the amount of computer resources
              ImageMagick is allowed to use.&nbsp; Any operation that
              exceeds those limits will fail, probably with unhelpful
              messages that do not allow you to isolate the
              problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, on my own system, I've had
              to pep up these limits quite a lot, long ago, for
              applications unrelated to flowcharting, so I have little
              idea how much <i>you'll</i> have to change the limits;
              probably less drastically than me.&nbsp; The
              resource-related policies that <i>may</i> require pepping
              up on your system currently read as follows on my system:</font><br>
            <blockquote><font size="-1"><tt>&lt;policy domain="resource"
                  name="memory" value="24GiB"/&gt;</tt><tt><br>

    <h2><a name="Building"></a>How to Build an LVDC Flowchart from
      Source Code</h2>
    <p>Creation of software flowcharts from LVDC source-code files is a
      multistep process, which in general looks like this:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Conversion of LVDC source-code files (*.lvdc) to flowcharts in
        <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)">the



          DOT graph-description language</a> is carried out by the
        program yaASMflowchart2.py.</li>
      <li>Conversion of DOT files to flowcharts in <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">the PostScript
          page-description language</a> is performed by the program
        called "dot" that is provided by your installation of graphviz.</li>
      <li>(Optionally) PostScript files are converted to other viewing
        formats (PNG, JPG, PDF, etc.) by graphics software such as
        ImageMagic, GIMP, maybe Adobe Acrobat, maybe Photoshop, etc.,
        though in general it's just easier to view the PostScript files
        directly in appropriate viewing software.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let's consider these steps in order.<br>
    </p>
    <p><i>Creation of DOT files from LVDC files</i>.&nbsp; Recall that
      any given LVDC flight program consists of a set of dozens of LVDC
      source-code files.&nbsp; We don't create a single, immense
      flowchart for an LVDC flight program as a whole.&nbsp; Rather, the
      flowcharting annotations in the LVDC software define many, many
      smaller flowcharts.&nbsp; Usually there's a single flowchart in an
      individual LVDC source file.&nbsp; But sometimes there are
      multiple flowcharts in a single source file, and sometimes (though
      rarely) there are none at all.&nbsp; The naming of the flowchart
      files is provided by the flowcharting annotations and <i>not</i>
      by the filenames of the source-code files.&nbsp; You can either
      process each source-code file individually, or else you can
      concatenate some or all of them and process them all at
      once.&nbsp; If yaASMflowchart2.py is in your PATH, from a command
      line you could process a single LVDC source-code file (say,
      SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY.lvdc) like so:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>yaASMflowchart2.py &lt;SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY.lvdc</tt><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Or in Linux, you could process all of the LVDC files in the
      current folder at once like this:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>cat *.lvdc | yaASMflowchart2.py</tt><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Windows, the corresponding command would be:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>type *.lvdc | yaASMflowchart2.py</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    The result of this operation is a bunch of DOT files, 93 in all if
    you're working with the entire set of AS-512 source-code files:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>ABSOLUTE-COMMAND_FREEZE_UTILITY_(FR).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>ACCELEROMETER_PROCESSING_(AP).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>ACCELEROMETER_READ_(AR).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>ACQUISITION_GAIN-LOSS_(GL).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>APS_ATTITUDE_CONTROL_TEST_(AC).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>ARCTANGENT_UTILITY_(AT).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>BOOST_NAVIGATION_(NE).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>CHI_COMPUTATIONS_(CC).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>CMC_CUTOFF_(CI).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>COMPRESSED_DATA_TELEMETRY_(CT).dot</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>.</tt><tt>..</tt><tt><br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    By the way, these DOT files can themselves be manually edited to
    change the appearance of the flowcharts, if you're expert enough in
    graphviz and the DOT language to do so.&nbsp; I wouldn't recommend
    doing that in general, since any changes you make to the DOT files
    directly are so easily overwritten later by yaASMflowchart2.py and
    thus lost.&nbsp; But the potential does exist.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Conversion of DOT files to PostScript</i>.&nbsp; Converting a
    single DOT file to PostScript format (again, say
    SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).dot), looks like this:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>dot -l sdl.ps "</tt><tt>SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).dot"



      </tt><tt>&gt;"SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).ps"</tt></blockquote>
    On some platforms, the surrounding quotes (single-quotes could be
    used instead) aren't needed, but on others the parentheses in the
    filename causes problems without the quotes, so you may as well just
    always include them.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the file sdl.ps just be either in the current folder, or
    else you'll have to provide a full path to where it is actually
    located.&nbsp; To make it simple above, I just assumed that it was
    in the current folder.<br>
    <br>
    Depending on your platform and what document-viewing software is
    installed on it, these *.ps (PostScript) file may now be directly
    viewable as flowcharts just by clicking on them with a mouse.&nbsp;
    Alas, on other platforms doing that may simply show you the files as
    text, which is pretty uninformative.&nbsp; It may be painful, but if
    it doesn't work at first, my advice to you would be to research the
    available solutions for directly viewing PostScript files on your
    system.&nbsp; There will be some free solution, but I simply don't
    know that it is for you.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Even on Linux it hasn't always been easy.&nbsp; For example, on my
    system, the default document viewer (xreader) displays the
    PostScript flowcharts just fine, but cannot zoom very large images
    appropriately; an alternate viewer (okular) works terrifically for <i>me</i>,
    but when I install okular on Windows it just shows the PostScript
    files as text.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Conversion of PostScript to other image formats</i>.&nbsp;
    Optionally, you may want to convert the PostScript files to image
    files like PNG, JPG, SVG, or PDF.&nbsp; My own advice, if you choose
    to do this, is to convert to PNG.&nbsp; The PNG files will be much
    smaller than JPG files; and while not as scalable as SVG will be
    more easily viewable in more contexts without additional software
    installation; and conversion to PDF will likely involve you in
    unpleasant discoveries about "paper size" (hint: you need very large
    paper sizes sometimes) that you won't have to worry about with PNG.<br>
    <br>
    The two cross-platform methods I've used with success for conversion
    are <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">GIMP</a> and <a
      moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php">ImageMagick</a>.&nbsp;



    Neither program directly supports PostScript; rather, each is a
    convenience layer using <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/index.html">ghostscript</a>
    to perform the actual conversion.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    GIMP is purely interactive, and is relatively convenient for
    converting a single file.&nbsp; If you ask it to load one of your
    PostScript files, there will be a pop-up asking you various
    questions about the conversion: I'd suggest using a "resolution" of
    96, "Color", "Strong" text antialiasing, and "Strong" graphic
    antialiasing.&nbsp; Once loaded, you can then use File/Export-as to
    output it as a PNG file.<br>
    <br>
    ImageMagick is purely command-line driven, and therefore is more
    useful than GIMP for batch conversions.&nbsp; The basic command in
    ImageMagick 6 for converting a single file, such as our
    SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).ps file, is<br>
    <blockquote><tt>convert -density 96 "</tt><tt>SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).ps</tt><tt>"
        -background white -flatten "</tt><tt>SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).png"</tt></blockquote>
    For ImageMagick 7, the "convert" command absurdly turns instead into
    the "magick" command but is otherwise the same:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>magick -density 96 "</tt><tt>SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).ps</tt><tt>"
        -background white -flatten "</tt><tt>SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY_(SR).png"</tt></blockquote>
    <h2><a name="Annotations"></a>Flowchart Annotations in LVDC Source
      Code</h2>
    <p>As I've mentioned, AS-512 and AS-513 flight-program source code
      contains various unexplained annotations among the program
      comments that usually have no immediately-obvious interpretation
      in terms of describing what the source code is doing.&nbsp; After
      contemplating the meaning of these for a couple of months, I
      formed an impression that these annotations may have something to
      do with flowcharts, and specifically may be hints for creating a
      flowchart of the associated code.&nbsp; Or possibly at one time
      had even been exact instructions for automating generation of
      flowcharts, but had deteriorated over time due to neglect and lack
      of programmer training.&nbsp; Whatever the explanation, in AS-512
      and AS-513, by my reckoning, the annotations can no longer be
      interpreted with 100% reliability.&nbsp; Thus the explanations I'm
      going to give you of these annotations and how to interpret (or
      edit) them are based on my own inferences, and have lots of
      exceptions where they don't agree with my explanations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Throughout this section, I'll illustrate my explanations using
      AS-512's MATRIX MULTIPLY UTILITY module.&nbsp; Here's the entire
      original source code for that module, sans and modern comments we
      added when transcribing it.&nbsp; Everything that I think is part
      of a flowcharting annotation in one way or another has been
      highlighted either in <font color="#ff0000">red</font>, <font
        color="#33cc00">green</font>, or <font color="#3333ff">blue</font>:<br>

    The <font color="#ff0000">red</font> annotations are clearly the
    most mysterious as they seem to have no purpose whatever in
    explicating the code.&nbsp; If present, they are invariably in
    column 71.&nbsp; (Recall that LVDC source-code was originally on
    80-column punch-cards and has a specific columnar alignment.)&nbsp;
    Some of these <font color="#ff0000">red</font> markings, in my
    view, give you high-level information about a flowchart:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#ff0000">J</font> indicates the start of a
        flowchart.&nbsp; It invariably appears only in full-line
        comments, and the remainder of the comment (shown above in <font
          color="#3333ff">blue</font>), minus any * or spaces at the
        beginning or end, is the title of the flowchart.</li>
      <li><font color="#ff0000">H</font> indicates the end of a
        flowchart.&nbsp; Any source-code lines not between <font
          color="#ff0000">J</font> and <font color="#ff0000">H</font>
        are not included in any flowchart.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Other than <font
          color="#ff0000">J</font> and <font color="#ff0000">H</font>
        lines, I currently just ignore all full-line comments, because I
        haven't figured out any reliable interpretation for them.&nbsp;
        It's possible they may be best interpreted as captions for
        blocks of flowchart elements, and that they should be printed on
        the flowchart separately from any individual boxes or
        arrows.&nbsp; I just don't know.&nbsp; However, omitting them
        doesn't seem to do much harm.</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    More often, <font color="#ff0000">red</font> annotations indicate
    that there's a flowchart box associated with the vicinity of that
    line of code, and tells you the shape of the box.&nbsp; Only a few
    of the many relatively-standardized flowchart shapes are used.&nbsp;
    How the captions of the boxes should be derived isn't entirely
    clear, and the flowchart-generator program tends to use a
    prioritized heuristic approach to figuring it out, as described in
    the following table.<br>

    And finally, there are various <font color="#ff0000">red</font>
    annotations in the original code that I haven't been able to discern
    any purpose for, and are simply ignored by the flowchart-generator
    software:&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">E</font> (perhaps "End of
    routine"), <font color="#ff0000">$</font> (perhaps a comment), <font
      color="#ff0000">*</font>, <font color="#ff0000">C</font> (perhaps
    "Completed").<br>
    <br>
    There are also a few exceptional cases in which the flowchart
    generator acts on the basis of the assembly-language code, even if
    unmarked by <font color="#ff0000">red</font> annotations:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Any line with a symbolic label may potentially appear in the
        flowchart as a TERMINAL box, captioned by the symbolic label
        itself.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Even without a symbolic label, any line may potentially appear
        in the flowchart as a TERMINAL box if it's the target of a <tt>HOP</tt>,
        <tt>TRA</tt>, <tt>TMI</tt>, or <tt>TNZ</tt> instruction.&nbsp;
        Without a symbolic label, the TERMINAL box will be captioned as
        "Line <i>N</i>", where <i>N</i> is the source-code line
        number.</li>
      <li>Unannotated <tt>TRA</tt> instructions are treated as if they
        were annotated by <font color="#ff0000">G</font>.</li>
      <li>Unannotated <tt>TMI</tt> and <tt>TNZ</tt> instructions are
        treated as if they were decision boxes (<font color="#ff0000">Q</font>)
        combined with <i>uncaptioned</i> exit arrows.</li>
      <li><b>Note</b>:&nbsp; Unannotated <tt>HOP</tt> instructions are
        not treated in any special way, since either <tt>P</tt> vs <tt>G</tt>
        could be the appropriate annotation, and the flowchart generator
        has no way to know which is which. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In most cases, the flowchart depicts control flow by following
      the simple rule that each flowchart box has an arrow to the next
      box, in the order that the annotations associated with the boxes
      are encountered in the source code.&nbsp; But there are exceptions
      that interrupt this simple default ordering:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#ff0000">S</font> boxes do not receive a default
        arrow from the preceding box.</li>
      <li>Boxes do not receive a default arrow if the preceding box is
        an <font color="#ff0000">X</font> box, a <font color="#ff0000">G</font>
        box, or if the preceding LVDC instruction was <tt>TRA</tt>.</li>
      <li>And there are certain rare cases involving <tt>Q</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>,
        and <tt>N</tt> in which there is no default arrow from the <tt>Q</tt>
        box to the next box.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Decision boxes are the trickiest aspect of program flow in the
      flowcharts.&nbsp; The stereotypical case is a two-way decision, in
      which the pattern of LVDC instructions and flowchart annotations
      looks like this:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <i>instructions

            to set up a test</i> ... <br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final instruction of
            the setup</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Q<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMI|TNZ <i>label1</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Y or N<br>
          <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; next instruction</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... additional
            instructions ...<br>
          </i></tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The flowchart associated with this has a decision box (labeled
      with the comment for the "final instruction of the setup"), an
      arrow captioned YES or NO to <i>label1</i>, and an arrow
      captioned NO or YES to the next box following the decision
      box.&nbsp; The complexity comes in because there are many ways to
      do this differently or even wrong, and the flowchart generator
      tries to handle as many of those exceptions as it can.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For one thing, suppose we instead had this:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <i>instructions

            to set up a test</i> ... <br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final instruction of
            the setup</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Q<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMI|TNZ <i>label1</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Y or N<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMI|TNZ <i>label2</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          N or Y<br>
          <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; next instruction</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... additional
            instructions ...<br>
          </i></tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is treated as a 3-way decision instead of a 2-way decision,
      so that we have an arrow captioned YES or NO to <i>label1</i>,
      and an arrow captioned NO or YES to <i>label2</i>, and an
      uncaptioned arrow to the next box following the decision
      box.&nbsp; Perhaps a bit misleading, but inescapable given that <font
        color="#ff0000">Y</font> and <font color="#ff0000">N</font> are
      the only <font color="#ff0000">red</font> annotations available
      for the arrow captioning.&nbsp; (Fortunately, there seem to be no
      4-way or higher decisions in LVDC code.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>A common situation, which may or may not be an error on the part
      of the original programmer, is when the <font color="#ff0000">Q</font>
      annotation is missing:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <i>instructions

            to set up a test</i> ... <br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final instruction of
            the setup</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMI|TNZ <i>label1</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Y or N<br>
          <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; next instruction</i><br>
          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... additional
            instructions ...<br>
          </i></tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this case, the flowchart generator compensates by inserting a
      decision box captioned by the comment associated with the <tt>TMI|TNZ</tt>
      (<i>not</i> from the "final instruction of the setup"), but
      otherwise proceeds as if the decision box had been present all
      along; i.e., there is still an arrow from the decision box to <i>label1</i>,
      and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I probably haven't captured all of the possible aberrations
      associated with decision-box annotations here, but the lesson is
      clear: poorly-annotated decision-boxes are fairly common.<br>
      <tt><i></i></tt></p>
    <h2><a name="FLOW"></a><tt>FLOW</tt> Directives</h2>
    <p>The <tt>FLOW</tt> directive is the mechanism provided to
      compensate for poor flowchart annotations in the original source
      code.&nbsp; A detailed worked-out example appears in the following
      section.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When you want to correct poor flowchart annotations, the first
      step is to determine what the correct annotations <i>should</i>
      have been.&nbsp; However, having determined the correct
      annotations, you can't simply modify the LVDC source code's
      annotations, because our unalterable rule is that the LVDC source
      code must match the original program listing <i>exactly</i>, even
      if the original code was in error.&nbsp; Because otherwise, we
      have no means of verifying that the transcription process was
      correct.&nbsp; But we do allow additions to the source code of
      directives defined only by the modern LVDC assembler and not
      accepted by the original LVDC assembler, because there's no way of
      confusing such a directive with incorrectly-transcribed source
      code.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The <tt>FLOW</tt> directive is one such modern-only addition to
      LVDC assembly language.&nbsp; The <tt>FLOW</tt> directive is
      placed on the line immediately preceding a line with poor
      flowchart annotations, and provides corrections to those
      annotations.&nbsp; However, the <tt>FLOW</tt> directive is used
      only by the flowchart generator program, and is entirely discarded
      by the modern LVDC assembler, so that the presence of <tt>FLOW</tt>
      directives does not in any way alter assembled LVDC code.<br>
    </p>
    <p>From the description in the preceding section, you'll have noted
      that the following characteristics of a line of LVDC code
      sometimes affect flowchart generation:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The <font color="#ff0000">red</font> annotation.</li>
      <li>The symbolic label of the line.</li>
      <li>The LVDC instruction.</li>
      <li>The operand of the LVDC instruction.</li>
      <li>(Intentionally blank; relates to a property of full-line
        comments that's no longer used).</li>
      <li>The "<font color="#33cc00"><i>label</i></font>" in a comment
        of the form "<font color="#33cc00">(<i>label</i>)</font><font
          color="#3333ff">remainder of comment</font>".</li>
      <li>The "<font color="#3333ff">remainder of comment</font>" in a
        comment of either the form "<font color="#33cc00">(<i>label</i>)</font><font
          color="#3333ff">remainder of comment</font>" or "<font
          color="#3333ff">remainder of comment</font>".<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The <tt>FLOW</tt> directive has 7 fields corresponding to these
      parameters (including the always-blank #5), and allows you to
      correct any or all of them for any given line of LVDC code.&nbsp;
      The format of a <tt>FLOW</tt>-directive line is:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>       FLOW    F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7<br></pre>
    <p>where the fields F1 and so on correspond to the 7 characteristics
      mentioned above.&nbsp; Note that there are no spaces shown.&nbsp;
      In fact, no spaces are allowed until F7 is reached, since F7 is
      the only one of the seven fields that can actually contain any
      spaces.&nbsp; Any field you <i>don't</i> want to provide a
      correction for is left empty.&nbsp; For example, the directive<br>
    </p>
    <pre>       FLOW    ,,,,,,<br></pre>
    <p>would correct nothing at all.&nbsp; If the correction you want to
      apply is to blank out something that isn't empty already, you can
      use the field ""; i.e., two double-quotes side-by-side.&nbsp; Thus
      the following command would blank out all seven flowchart
      characteristics:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>       FLOW    "","","","","","",""<br></pre>
    The most-common use of <tt>FLOW</tt> is probably to change the <font
      color="#ff0000">red</font> annotation.&nbsp; For example, here is
    a directive to turn a line into a decision box and provide a caption
    for it that differs from what's on the source-code line:<br>
    <pre>       FLOW    Q,,,,,,MY DECISION?<br></pre>
    There are also a couple of new <font color="#ff0000">red</font>
    annotations you can use, invented solely for the modern assembler
    and not present in original LVDC code.&nbsp; They're intended mostly
    for internal use by the flowchart generator, but can sometimes be
    used to good effect in <tt>FLOW</tt> directives:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#ff0000">?</font> indicates a decision box, and
        at the same time an uncaptioned exit arrow from the box.&nbsp;
        It's like a <font color="#ff0000">Y</font> or <font
          color="#ff0000">N</font> unaccompanied by a preceding <font
          color="#ff0000">Q</font> (as described above) but without any
        caption on the arrow.<br>
      </li>
      <li> <font color="#ff0000">-</font> is used for marking lines
        that have a symbolic label but are otherwise without flowchart
        annotations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, suppose you had code like so,<br>
    </p>
    <pre>       TMI     *+1<br>       TRA     <i>label</i><br>       ... <i>some instruction</i> ...<br></pre>
    <p>The TMI instruction will turn into a decision box and will want
      to have an arrow to "some instruction", but "some instruction" has
      no symbolic label, and thus the flowchart generator will want to
      insert a terminal box with a caption like "Line <i>N</i>".&nbsp;
      But if you instead inserted a <tt>FLOW</tt> directive, <br>
    </p>
    <pre>       TMI     *+1<br>       TRA     <i>label<br></i>       FLOW    -,MYLABL,,,,,<br>       ... <i>some instruction</i> ...<br></pre>
    it would instead insert a terminal box captioned "MYLABL" ... which
    may or may not be more meaningful than "Line <i>N</i>".&nbsp; (It's
    just an example!)<br>

      UTILITY Module of AS-512</h2>

        alt="" align="right" width="325" height="1222">What I'd like to
      do in this section is work through a real-life example, namely
      that of the SQUARE ROOT UTILITY module from the AS-512 flight
      program that has already been used several times above as an
      example.&nbsp; It's a very short file that has a relatively-large
      number of potential improvements.&nbsp; Fixing it up the flowchart
      will thus be a lot of work, but at the same time we'll gain a lot
      of understanding about the code along the way. <br>
    </p>
    <p>To the left is the relevant portion of the source-code file,
      which I've chosen to look at using the vim editor, because LVDC
      syntax-highlighting is available in vim.&nbsp; Whereas to the
      right we see the flowchart generated from that source code as-is.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, one issue with the flowchart is that we <i>may</i>
      have succeeded in accurately reproducing the program flow — that
      remains to be seen! — but inadequate flowcharting annotations in
      the original source code may not have allowed decent labeling of
      some of the boxes or arrows in the flowchart.&nbsp; You can see
      this particularly in the decision boxes labeled "Line 68", "Line
      77", and "Line 85", and in the associated entry points labeled
      "Line 70", "Line 76", and "Line 88".&nbsp; Why these goofy
      labels?&nbsp; It's because there's nothing in the source code that
      tells the flowchart-generator software anything meaningful about
      the test being performed or the significance of the test
      results.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>So if we want to fix up the flowchart at those points with <i>meaningful</i>
      captions, we have to use our soft human brains to figure out the <i>intent</i>
      of the original source code.&nbsp; This will require actual
      thinking and rummaging around in the LVDC source code, and cannot
      be done in some formulaic rote fashion.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Let's first see if we can figure out what's happening at line 68
      of the source code and its environs.&nbsp; According to the
      comments at the top of the source code, subroutine <tt>U.SR00</tt>
      accepts a number (let's call it <i>x</i>) in the accumulator
      register and is supposed to compute its square root.&nbsp; <tt>D.VUTB</tt>
      (a variable), it tells us, contains the "previous square root of
      argument".&nbsp; So presumably one would load an initial guess for
      the square root (perhaps <i>x</i>/2) into <tt>D.VUTB</tt> before
      calling <tt>U.SR00</tt> the first time, and could then keep
      calling <tt>U.SR00</tt> iteratively in order to keep refining the
      square-root value.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It's too bad that the comments in the source code don't actually
      <i>say</i> that, and instead force us to <i>presume</i> it.&nbsp;
      As it happens, there is external documentation that can help us
      out somewhat, sometimes, in figuring out stuff like this.&nbsp;
      The external documentation I speak of is something called the
      Equation Defining Document (EDD).&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are
      several separate EDDs, and we only have the one called "LVDC
      Equation Defining Document (EDD) for the Saturn IB Flight
      Program".&nbsp; Which is <i>not</i> what the AS-512 flight
      program is, given that AS-512 used a Saturn V launch
      vehicle.&nbsp; But still, it's close enough in some ways to be
      helpful.&nbsp; Rather than making you look in <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="links2.html">the document library</a>
      for the document, here are direct links to the various parts of
      that EDD:<br>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Now, if you look at line 79 in the source code, you'll notice a
      reference to EQ. 13.6.1.&nbsp; That's an equation in the EDD,
      though since we have a different version of the EDD, it's not
      necessarily the same equation number.&nbsp; As it happens, in the
      Saturn IB EDD it's section 13.5 (rather than 13.6) that describes
      SQUARE ROOT ALGORITHM, so the relevant equation is 13.5.1.&nbsp;
      Let me quote the EDD in full:<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="EDD-13.5.jpg"
        alt="" width="482" height="368"></div>
    <br>
    With that explanation, it now becomes clear that the test being
    performed at line 68 is whether or not <i>x</i>/2 is less than the
    estimated root, <tt>D.VUTB</tt>.&nbsp; Which not coincidentally, is
    what the comment for <i>next</i> line, line 69, says.&nbsp; Thus if
    lines 67-69 of the source code had been annotated <i>properly</i>
    for flowcharting, they should instead read:<br>
    <pre>       SUB     D.VUTB       IS 1/2 ARGUMENT LESS THAN FIRST GUESS     Q
       TMI     *+2                                                    Y<br>       TRA     SR10                                                   N<br></pre>
    <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="flow-1.png" alt="" align="left"
      width="282" height="353">But what are we going to do about
    it?&nbsp; Our own rules for transcribing the LVDC source code are to
    do so <i>as-is</i>, including all errors, so we can't just go in
    and "fix" the program comments according to how we imagine they
    should have been done way back when.&nbsp; What we do instead is to
    add <tt>FLOW</tt> directives, which don't exist in the original
    LVDC assembly language, and thus are unambiguously "modern", without
    changing any of the original lines.&nbsp; Here's what that looks
    like:<br>
    <pre>       FLOW    Q,,,,,,IS 1/2 ARGUMENT LESS THAN FIRST GUESS<br>       SUB     D.VUTB<br>       FLOW    Y,,,,,,<br>       TMI     *+2<br>       TRA     SR10         IS 1/2 ARGUMENT LESS THAN FIRST GUESS     N<br></pre>
    I could have added a <tt>FLOW</tt> directive here to remove the
    comment from line 69, but there's no need to do so, since that
    comment never shows up the flowchart.&nbsp; But regardless, the
    section of the flowchart related to Line 68 and its environs has now
    changed to the more-pleasant form seen at left.<br>
    <br>
    Although the decision box for line 68 has been fixed, the entry
    point formerly labeled "Line 70" (but now "Line 72" because of the
    addition of the two <tt>FLOW</tt> directives) has not.&nbsp; The
    problem is that the <tt>TMI *+2</tt> (formerly at line 68 but now
    at line 70) jumps to <tt>*+2</tt>, but there's no symbolic label at
    <tt>*+2</tt>.&nbsp; The flowchart generator makes up its own label
    for <tt>*+2</tt> ... namely, "Line 72".&nbsp; But if you look at
    what happens after reaching "Line 72", the code simply progresses
    straight to <tt>SR05</tt> with no intervening annotations or even
    program comments:&nbsp; i.e., with nothing relevant to the flowchart
    in between.&nbsp; So as far as the flowchart is concerned, instead
    of <tt>TMI *+2</tt> it may as well have been <tt>TMI SR05</tt>.&nbsp;



    Let's add a FLOW directive to that effect:<br>
    <pre>       FLOW    Y,,,SR05,,,<br>       TMI     *+2<br></pre>
    <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="flow-2.png" alt="" align="right"
      width="281" height="182">Remember, <tt>FLOW</tt> directives do
    not affect the assembly of the source code in any way, so <tt>TMI
      *+2</tt> still assembles as <tt>TMI *+2</tt> regardless of any <tt>FLOW</tt>
    directives we may choose to stick in front.&nbsp; The result of this
    change, seen to the right, is exactly what we desired.<br>
    <br>
    The next problems to be addressed are at the original lines 76 and
    77, but which are now lines 78 and 79 due to the addition of <tt>FLOW</tt>
    directives in the meantime.&nbsp; It's tiring talking about all of
    these changing line numbers, so from now on whenever I mention a
    line number, it will always be from the <i>original</i> source code
    and flowchart, <i>sans</i> <tt>FLOW</tt> directives.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Here's a pro tip for
        you.&nbsp; Fix the flowcharting problems from the <i>bottom</i>
        of the source-code file <i>upward</i>.&nbsp; That way, addition
        of FLOW directives doesn't keep messing up the line numbers!</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    Original lines 76 and 77 apparently constitute some kind of delay
    loop, starting with a count of <tt>D.KB24</tt>, and then
    decrementing that count by <tt>D.KB25</tt> until it becomes
    negative.&nbsp; Not that it really matters what the specific values
    of <tt>D.KB24</tt> and <tt>D.KB25</tt> are, but looking at where
    they're allocated in the GFP DATA PACK module, we find that they're
    4 and 2, respectively ... so it's actually a very short delay
    indeed.&nbsp; At any rate, the code originally looks like this,<br>
    <pre>       SUB     D.KB25<br>       TNZ     *-1<br>       CLA     D.VUTB<br></pre>
    <pre><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="flow-3.png" alt="" align="left" width="220" height="218"></pre>
    but it seems as though we should update it to:<br>
    <pre>       FLOW    Q,,,,,,DIVISION DELAY COMPLETE?<br>       SUB     D.KB25<br>       FLOW    N,,,,,,<br>       TNZ     *-1<br>       CLA     D.VUTB<br></pre>
    which indeed repairs it as shown to the left.<br>
    <br>
    Now let's look at the problems related to (original) lines 85 and
    88.&nbsp; Back at (original) line 71, a value of 2 was stored in the
    variable <tt>D.VUTB+2</tt>.&nbsp; What's happening near line 85 is
    that <tt>D.VUTB+2</tt> is decremented by 1, and jumps back to <tt>SR05</tt>
    as long as <tt>D.VUTB+2</tt> doesn't become negative.&nbsp; In
    other words, <tt>SR05</tt> is the start of a loop, <tt>D.VUTB+2</tt>
    is the loop counter, and the loop is executed 3 times, for <tt>D.VUTB+2</tt>
    equal to 2, 1, and then 0.&nbsp; So it seems as though we need the
    following <tt>FLOW</tt> directives at (original) lines 84 and 85:<br>
    <pre>       FLOW    Q,,,,,,3 ITERATIONS COMPLETED?<br>       SUB     =1<br>       FLOW    Y,,,,,,<br>       TMI     *+3<br>       STO     D.VUTB+2<br>       TRA     SR05<br>       FLOW    -,DONE,,,,,<br>       CLA     D.VUTB<br></pre>
    The mysterious "<tt>FLOW -,DONE,,,,,</tt>" near the bottom is there
    to provide a label (<tt>"DONE"</tt>) to which the decision box can
    exit, since otherwise it would exit to the (unlabeled) "Line <i>something</i>".<br>
    <br>
    Putting this all together, we end up with the following pepped-up
    source code and flowchart for it:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="SQUARE_ROOT_UTILITY-2.png" alt="" width="532" height="1101">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="flow-4.png" alt="" width="328"
        height="922"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Once these things are in hand, the next step is to compare them to
    see whether or not the flowchart accurately and usefully reflects
    what the source code is doing?&nbsp; Since we're only looking about
    about a page of relatively-simple code here, it's pretty easy to do
    that without a lot of yakety yak from me.&nbsp; The "DONE" entry
    point in the flowchart looks a bit weird, since there's no actual
    label "DONE" in the source code, but I don't know what can be done
    about that, if anything.&nbsp; About the only other obvious thing is
    to wonder where the division referenced by the "DIVISION DELAY
    COMPLETE?" decision box is?&nbsp; Thus one might want to add a <tt>FLOW</tt>
    directive such as<br>
    <pre>       FLOW    B,,,,,,DIVIDE BY CURRENT ESTIMATE<br></pre>
    at (current) line 75 so that the <tt>DIV</tt> operation shows up in
    the flowchart.&nbsp; The final, <i>final</i> version of the
    flowchart, unless I or somebody else keeps thinking about it, thus
    becomes:<br>
