      </small></h2>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> is the program
    which was run on the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) installed in the
    Command Module (CM) for Apollo 8 through 17.&nbsp; In order to be
    loaded into the AGC—actually, to be converted to the "core ropes"
    within the AGC — it was orginally necessary to "assemble" <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>'s source code into
    binary machine language, using a computer program called <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span> or its successor program, <b>GAP</b>.&nbsp;










    In the context of the Virtual AGC project, of course, the process is
    somewhat different:&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
    source code is assembled by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
    program, and then loaded into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
    simulation.<br>

      style="font-weight: bold;">Sunspot</span> were pre-<span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> versions of the Command
    Module AGC's software.&nbsp; They were not forms of <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> as such, but provided
    some code for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>.&nbsp;
If

















    you click on the image to the right, you can see a simplified family
    tree for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> program
    eventually had three major versions, not surprisingly known as <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 1 (COLOSSUS), <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 2 (COMANCHE), and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 3 (ARTEMIS).&nbsp;
    Additionally, there were minor versions such as <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 1A, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 2C, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SKYLARK</span> was post-<span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> Command-Module
    software, but it was simply adapted from ARTEMIS.<br>
    <br>
    And that doesn't even begin to cover the varieties of software
    developed for the AGC installed in the Lunar Module (LM), which you

          <td valign="middle"><a name="TRIVIUM"></a>This is an unusual
            program, in that its sole purpose was to demonstrate usage
            of the original AGC assembler, YUL.&nbsp; In fact, its very
            short program listing (only one page of source code!) that
            was attached to a 1963 manual for YUL.&nbsp; The document
            itself was obtained from the personal papers of the late
            Russel Larson.<br>
            <span id="moreTRIVIUM" style="display:none"> <br>
              The program is for a Block I AGC, and thus is not only one
              of the very few Block I AGC programs that has survived,
              but is probably the earliest such program that will ever
              be found.<br>
              <br>
              The program itself contains a pedagogically deliberate
              error — one of the variables it references is not defined
              within the program — and thus YUL could not fully assemble
              it.&nbsp; Besides that error, there are three
              also-deliberate items in the program that are not aligned
              at the proper punch-card columns:&nbsp; one program label,
              one operator, and one operand.&nbsp; YUL was apparently
              fine with those misalignments, though our modern
              assembler, <a href="yaYUL.html">yaYUL</a>, is not, and it
              treats two of them as errors.&nbsp; In spite of all that,
              however, yaYUL's assembly of the code is remarkably like
              YUL's.<br>
              <br>
              Because TRIVIUM contained these deliberate errors and
              oddities, we're actually providing it for you in two
              forms:&nbsp; TRIVIUM (as hyperlinked at the left)
              corresponds exactly to the original program, errors and
              all, while <a
                href="listings/TRIVIUM-repaired/MAIN.agc.html">TRIVIUM-repaired</a>
              fixes those errors, and thus assembles as a
              syntactically-correct program.<br>
              <br>
              However ... you may notice that the program identifies
              itself as being by "IMA NIT-PICKER".&nbsp; I surmised that
              IMA may really have been Hugh Blair-Smith, and Hugh tells
              me that that is indeed true.&nbsp; The name IMA NIT-PICKER
              is actually a tongue-and-cheek reference to Richard Volpi,
              the principal author of the AGC Information Series
              document (hyperlinked at the left) in which the program
              appears.&nbsp; Richard apparently tended to pay an
              enormous amount of attention to detail, and hence (Hugh
              says) was the <i>true</i> nit-picker.&nbsp; (See also the
              comments about Volpi in Hugh's book, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Left-Brains-Right-Stuff-Computers/dp/0996434534">Left
Brains




























                for the Right Stuff</a>.)&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Amusingly, though, in reviewing the program after all
              these years (about 55 of them!), Hugh was surprised to
              notice that even with the assembly-time error fixed, the
              program does not actually work.&nbsp; Given that the
              program is less than 20 lines long altogether, that may
              hint at some of the difficulties involved in writing AGC
              software.&nbsp; As to exactly what's wrong with the
              program, I leave that as an exercise for the reader!<br>

              69 and Erasable Memory Test Program</a><br>
          </td>
          <td valign="middle"><a name="SUNRISE"></a>
          SUNRISE is a program
            used for Block I system tests, providing a similar service,
            I guess, to what the SUNDIAL program later provided for
            Block II, and which AURORA provided for the LM.&nbsp; We
            acquired SUNRISE 45 by dumping the contents of three
            physical rope-memory modules to which an anonymous collector
            gave us access.<br>
	    <span id="moreSUNRISE45" style="display:none"><br>
	    Now, it often happens that physical rope-memory modules are
            physically defective in one way or another, either as a
            result of sitting around for 50-60 years unused, or perhaps
            due to defective modules being more likely to have been
            discarded and thus more likely to have found their way into
            collectors' collections in the first place.&nbsp; Usually,
            due to fact that these memory modules have a 16th (parity)
            bit in addition to the 15 data bits at each memory location,
            these flaws are relatively easy to correct.&nbsp; The
            SUNRISE 45 rope is notable in that <i>one</i> of the three
            memory modules was rather more severely damaged than usual,
            but that Mike Stewart was able to deduce corrections for it
            anyway.&nbsp; We had a high degree of confidence in those
            corrections ... but still, they were unusually difficult to
            make, and we'd have even more confidence in the dumped data
            if those corrections hadn't needed to be made in the first
            place.<br>
            <br>
            Fortunately, we were later able to obtain a dump from a
            different physical memory module containing those very same
            memory banks of SUNRISE 45.&nbsp; While this module <i>also</i>
            had flaws, they were all easy to correct, and in any case
            did not overlap the flaws in the originally-dumped
            module.&nbsp; We were thus able to verify that all of Mike's
            original corrections were indeed correct! By this roundabout
            route, we can now have complete confidence in our dump of
            SUNRISE 45. Many thanks to the module's owner, Larry
            McGlynn!<br>
            <br>
            If you're interested in the sordid details, there's a full
            description in <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/Rope-Module%20Dump%20Library/README.md#Inventory">the



              README for our "Rope Module Dump Library"</a> that
            contains all of our dumps of physical rope-memory modules
            and any of the corrections that had to be made.&nbsp; Just
            find the entries describing 1003133-20 (the anonymous
            collector's module) and 1003733-021 (Larry McGlynn's
            module).<br>
            <br>
            Ultimately, given the octal listing of the software provided
            by these dumps of the physical memory modules — <i>and</i>
            a few months of effort with "lots of help from" Nik Beug —
            Mike was able to reconstruct the original AGC source
            code.&nbsp; I won't elaborate here on that process, except
            to say that with all such reconstructions you have to
            realize that things like program comments and symbolic
            labels for variables, constant, subroutines, and so forth
            may not be 100% exact.&nbsp; But the source code does
            assemble to give an identical core rope to what was
            contained in the physical modules, and is certainly a lot
            easier to understand than an octal listing!&nbsp; So while
            we can't expect perfection, this is likely as close to it as
            you're going to get.<br>
            <br>
            Here are some things Mike tells me you can <i>do</i> with
            Sunrise 45:<br>
            <div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode">
              <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
                charset=UTF-8">
              <h3 dir="auto">AGC Self-Check</h3>
              <p dir="auto">Sunrise 45 has a very early version of
                self-check that doesn't include erasable tests, fixed
                memory checks, etc. It essentially only has the control
                pulse tests. To kick it off:</p>
              <ul dir="auto">
                <li>VERB 21 NOUN 27 ENTER XXXXX ENTER</li>
              </ul>
              <p dir="auto">where XXXXX is the number of times you want
                it to execute. If XXXXX is negative, it will instead
                loop forever until a new N27 is entered or an error is
                encountered. The high-level results can be monitored
                with:</p>
              <ul dir="auto">
                <li>VERB 15 NOUN 01 ENTER 1570 ENTER</li>
              </ul>
              <p dir="auto">The first register will contain the address
                (within bank 5) of the first failure encountered. The
                next two registers are a double-precision count of
                successful test completions. When all is working, this
                will count up very quickly.</p>
              <h3 dir="auto">Orbital Integration</h3>
              <p dir="auto">The orbital integration section of Sunrise
                is essentially a test program that propagates a very
                low-altitude Earth orbit for just a bit more than one
                orbit. It can be started with verb 37 as follows:</p>
              <ul dir="auto">
                <li>VERB 37 ENTER 11 ENTER</li>
                <li>KEY RLSE</li>
              </ul>
              <p dir="auto">The program will change to 02, and it will
                put up a V07N01 display of address 1315. In this
                display, registers 1 and 2 are a double-precision
                fractional simulation time in weeks. It will slowly
                count up until it reaches 0.009 weeks, i.e. 90 minutes,
                at which point the program will exit. While it's
                running, the double-precision vectors <tt>RDISP</tt>
                (position in kilometers scaled 2<sup>-14</sup>, address
                1431) and <tt>VDISP</tt> (velocity in meters per
                second, scaled 2<sup>6</sup> 10<sup>-3</sup> √μ&nbsp;
                address 1437) can be examined one element at a time with
                a manual V07N01. I don't think there's a good way to
                display the whole vector.</p>
              <h3 dir="auto">Other Tests</h3>
              <p dir="auto">The other tests available in Sunrise are
                Prelaunch Alignment, Gryo Drift Test, and PIPA Scale
                Factor Test. All three share two common traits: they're
                not terribly useful/interesting in a standalone emulator
                without a simulated inertial subsystem, and they're all
                very well-documented in the AGC Information Series,
                unlike self-test and orbital integration.</p>

          <td valign="middle">The same comments I made for SUNRISE 45
            above basically hold equally well for SUNRISE 69, with the
            differences that the AGC source code for it has not (yet?)
            been 100% reconstructed, and that SUNRISE 69 spans four
            rope-memory modules rather than just three.&nbsp; What's
            really interesting, however, is that the four memory modules
            are the <i>same</i> three from SUNRISE 45, plus one extra.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you think about it, that's pretty remarkable.&nbsp; After
            all, if the three SUNRISE 45 modules never access a 4th rope
            module, then how would the code in the 4th rope module ever
            be reached when you're running SUNRISE 69?&nbsp; The answer
            is apparently (and obviously, I admit) that there are
            verb/noun combinations that you can use in SUNRISE 45 to
            transfer control to an address in the extra rope-memory
            module, which is designated B22.&nbsp; (The first three
            modules are B28, B29, and B21.)&nbsp; For example, the
            SUNRISE 69 DSKY electroluminescent test is kind of fun, and
            it's started by the rather cumbersome command sequence,<br>
            <br>
            <div align="center">VERB 21 NOUN 25 ENTER 30000 ENTER<br>
              VERB 20 NOUN 01 ENTER 15233 ENTER<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Whereas if you were to attempt the same thing in SUNRISE 45,
            it doesn't initiate the test.&nbsp; Rather, control is lost
            and all further key entries on the DSKY seem to be
            ignored.&nbsp; I'd expect that memory-parity errors would be
            encountered if this happened on a physical AGC, and that it
            would cause a system reset; since that doesn't happen
            virtually, I must not support parity checking in the CPU
            emulator.&nbsp; It sounds like the kind of thing I'd do.<br>
            <br>
            It seems to be the latter command, V20N01E XXXXXE which is
            used to enter the address of the code to be executed in the
            4th memory module ... or I suppose, <i>any</i> other memory
            module.&nbsp; It's apparently the <tt>CADR</tt> of the
            address (if you're up on your AGC assembly-language
            pseudo-ops).<br>

                  octal data.&nbsp; But with some luck, perhaps we can
                  convert this waveform data into an octal dump of the
                  rope, and from that point, convert it back into Block
                  1 AGC source code, to be presented here.&nbsp; Right
                  now this is just a plan rather than a reality, and

              The exact version of SUNSPOT that would have flown isn't
              presently known to me. The only GSOP volume we have
              references SUNSPOT 238, while SUNSPOT 247 is the revision
              TRW evaluated in their independent validation
              testing.&nbsp; The report mentions that problems were
              found and had since been fixed, prior to the date of the
              report (12/13/1966).&nbsp; Further, the testing apparently
              involved digital simulation rather than a physical AGC, so
              it was not limited to SUNSPOT revisions for which memory
              modules had been manufactured.&nbsp; Therefore, the
              version that would have been in the AGC at mission time
              must be at least 247, but most likely a later
              version.&nbsp; On the other hand, the TRW report also
              refers to SUNSPOT 247 as being an "A-release", which
              implies two things: firstly, that it was released, and
              secondly that it was intended for flight hardware (as
              opposed to being just some random engineering revision,
              which would have been a B-release).<br>
              <br>
              A factoid of some slight interest is that in spite of the
              general lack of information about the SUNSPOT program, we
              do know some internal details of the actual SUNSPOT
              revision that would have flown.&nbsp; The monthly MIT/IL
              "Weight and Balance Report", document E-1142, lists
              SUNSPOT's allocations of fixed memory in its July, August,
              and September 1966 reports, but only references SUNSPOT
              development (without listing its allocations) in the June
              1966 report.&nbsp; The allocations are precisely the same
              from July through September, and the reports clearly state
              as well that the software is for AS-204 (Apollo 1) and
              AS-205 (Apollo 2).&nbsp; There were no reports in October
              through December, and the January 1967 report, produced
              just <i>before</i> the fire, does not mention SUNSPOT at
              all. From which it would be reasonable to conclude that
              work on the Apollo 1 had finished up sometime between the
              June and July reports, and development had proceeded to
              other software.&nbsp; Recall that the Apollo 1 fire was on
              January 27, 1967, and that the planned launch date was
              February 21, 1967.<br>

                  height="160" border="2" align="right"></a>Coming at it
              from a different angle, Table 4-I from volume 3 of report
              R-700 (which actually appears at the top of this page)
              mentions only one SUNSPOT revision, 1021107-031, "released
              to manufacture" in July 1966.&nbsp; This appears to
              completely agree with the reasoning above, except that the
              table also refers to it as used in "APOLLO 3 Manned Earth
              Orbital (not flown) BL I."&nbsp; "Apollo 3" could be a
              reference to the canceled AS-207/208 mission, except that
              that would have been a Block II spacecraft, not Block I;
              beyond that, I'm not aware of any then-planned Block I
              mission to which "Apollo 3" could refer, so it's a
              mystery.<br>
              <br>
              Another mystery is that AS-204A and AS-205A (Apollo 1 and
              2) would have seemingly used different revisions of
              SUNSPOT.&nbsp; The TRW independent software evaluation
              refers to these as the A-release and B-release, but
              mentions that their own evaluation used only the
              A-release.&nbsp; It would be odd if the A- and B-releases
              used identical fixed-memory allocations, unless the
              differences were something that used the same amounts of
              memory, such as changes to the ephemeris.&nbsp; The 1969
              specification for the K-START tape numbering system — that
              being the tape system that stored the core-rope images —
              does reference both "Sunspot" and "Sunspot B
              Revision".&nbsp; So it seems likely that A was for Apollo
              1 and B was for Apollo 2, but with identical fixed-memory
              allocations for some reason.<br>
              <br>
              At any rate, if we assume that the fixed-memory allocation
              for the revision of SUNSPOT listed in these Weight and
              Balance Reports is indeed that targeted for Apollo 1, and
              was indeed being manufactured for it, then those
              allocations looked like the accompanying figure (click to

            but it did have a working CSM and a working AGC in the
            CM.&nbsp; <br>
            <span id="moreSOLARIUM54" style="display:none"> <br>
              This was a Block I spacecraft.<br>
              <br>
              The "Programer"—yes, that's the real spelling, though some
              sources do refer to it as the "programmer"—was a gadget
              that was the stand-in for the crew.<br>
              <br>
              Regarding the software itself you'll note that we say that
              SOLARIUM 54 was used in the mission, whereas if you look
              at the entry for Apollo 6 below, you'll see that we say
              SOLARIUM 55 was used there. However, Jay Sampson, who
              coded the changes from the Corona (AS-202) code to derive
              Solarium (AS-501), is insistent that there were no code
              changes between missions AS-501 (Apollo 4) and AS-502
              (Apollo 6).&nbsp; He does note that he had left MIT
              between Apollo 4 and 6 rather than after Apollo 6, and
              thus there is a tiny time window in which such changes
              could have occurred without his knowledge.&nbsp; Still, he
              believes that Solarium 54 is actually 100% identical to
              Solarium 55 (see below).&nbsp; Jay speculates that they
              simply rebuilt the memory rope, without changing the
              source code, and gave it a new number.<br>
              <br>
              Going one step beyond Jay's argument, I'd point also to
              Table 4-I from Volume 3 of the MIT/IL report R-700.&nbsp;
              According to that table, "SOLRUM 55", assembly number
              1021108-021 — both of which are marked at the tops of the
              pages of our SOLARIUM 55 printout — were used for "Apollo
              4, 6 Unmanned High Apogee Suborbital".&nbsp; In other
              words, it was used for <i>both</i> Apollo 4 and Apollo
              6.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Going one step even beyond that, we can consult the actual
              engineering drawings for the G&amp;N systems of the Apollo
              4 and Apollos 6 missions. These are provided as
              "drilldowns" of the <a href="1014999-111.html">Apollo 4
                G&amp;N system (assembly 1014999-111)</a> and the <a
                href="1014999-121.html">Apollo 6 G&amp;N system
                (assembly 1014999-121)</a>. When you drill down until
              you reach the "computer program assembly" (which specified
              which software was used to manufacture the core-rope
              memory modules), you find that <i>both</i> Apollo 4 and 6
              used computer program assembly 1021108-021, and that's
              exactly what's marked at the top of every page of the
              SOLARIUM 55 software listing. It's also worth looking at
              drawing <a
href="https://archive.org/details/apertureCardBox451Part2NARASW_images/page/n865/mode/1up?view=theater">1021108</a>.
              As it happens, the drawing does show that there were two
              software releases manufactured into memory modules, namely
              -011 and -021, so <i>perhaps</i> the -011 release could
              have been SOLARIUM 54; we just don't know. But even if so,
              the remainder of the drawing hierarchy says it wasn't used
              on Apollo 4. (Interestingly, SOLARIUM 54 and 55 are pretty
              similar, and are seen to differ only in one of the 6
              memory modules. But again, that's irrelevant to Apollo 4.
              It's also interesting that the drawing lists the function
              of -021 as <code>FLIGHT MISSION</code>, but doesn't
              bother to list any function for the -011 modules and says
              that its <code>LAUNCH PERIOD</code> is <code>N/A</code>.)<br>
              <br>
              All roads having led back to the same conclusion, unless
              other evidence is uncovered, I will therefore presume it
              is a proven fact that Apollo 4 and 6 used identical
              software, namely SOLARIUM 55.<br>
              <br>
              I suppose at this point, we may wonder where the idea even
              arose that SOLARIUM 54 was used in Apollo 4, since every
              bit of evidence seems to say otherwise? Well, originally,
              we didn't have feedback from Jay Sampson nor a large pile
              of engineering drawings to consult, so some of these ideas
              came from scrounging through various less-official
              documentation to scrounge every clue. This idea seems to
              have come from <a href="hrst/archive/967.pdf#page=31">a
                brief note in volume I of the MIT/IL report R-700</a>,
              which appears to say:
              <pre>                      November 1966     SOLARIUM 54 mission program released for APOLLO 4 (CM).
                                        SOLARIUM 55 mission program released for APOLLO 6 (CM).
              </pre>
              Indeed, this is the <i>only</i> reference to SOLARIUM 54
              I find in the contemporary documentation. Now as it
              happens, the scan of that volume of R-700 was partially
              mutilated in the digitization process; optical character
              recognition (OCR) settings were used which <i>discarded</i>
              the scanned imagery wherever possible and replaced it with
              OCR-created text instead. Which is fine until the OCR
              processing makes a mistake. If it originally said
              "SOLARIUM 55" but the OCR processor mistakenly read
              "SOLARIUM 54", then SOLARIUM 54 is what shows up in the
              final PDF and all trace of the original SOLARIUM 55
              vanishes. So perhaps that happened in this case. Unless we
              can find a hardcopy of the document again, we may never
              know.<br>
              <br>
              But enough about SOLARIUM 55 vs SOLARIUM 54!<br>
              <br>
              As mentioned above, Apollo 4 used a Block 1 spacecraft,
              and thus Solarium is Block 1 AGC software.&nbsp; As such,
              Apollo 4 missions cannot be simulated with the "normal"
              (Apollo Block 2) NASSP add-on for the Orbiter Spacecraft
              simulator.&nbsp; However, Nik Beug has gone to the trouble
              of <a href="https://github.com/indy91/NASSP/tree/BlockI">integrating




























                Virtual AGC's Block 1 AGC emulator into a branch of
                NASSP</a>, as well as creating a an emulator for the
              "Mission Programer" mentioned above, and Mike Stewart
              assisted by fixing the show-stopper bugs I had unwittingly
              left in the AGC emulator.&nbsp; (Naturally those fixes are
              in our <a
                href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/yaAGCb1">own




























                software repository</a>, in addition to NASSP's.)&nbsp;
              Thanks Nik and Mike!&nbsp; Nik then went ahead to make
              videos of the simulated Apollo 4 mission, which are linked
              below.<br>
              <br>
              You'll notice in the videos that the CM's control panel
              (and in particular the DSKY) are for Block 2 rather than
              Block 1.&nbsp; While Nik did the work to integrate the
              correct Block 1 AGC emulator, the AGC software, and their
              interface to the spacecraft, I presume that updating
              NASSP's control-panel appearance from Block 2 to Block 1
              was simply more work than he had bargained for.&nbsp; It
              doesn't matter operationally, of course.&nbsp; But perhaps
              someday, somebody with free time on their hands will code
              up a Block 1 control panel for Nik's Block 1 NASSP branch.<br>
              <br>
              By the way, the videos will probably be reduced in size
              here (by about 2.4×), so once the video gets started, you
              might want to click on the full-screen logo, or on the
              YouTube logo to actually view the video at YouTube.<br>
              <br>
              Part 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first half of the mission from
              turning on the AGC through the (not-quite) TLI maneuver

              could have been separated and perform a SPS burn
              controlled by Solarium to at least reach the recovery zone
              in the east Atlantic for a controlled splashdown.<br>

              2TV-1 mission</a> that I won't paraphrase here, except to
            say that it comprised four substantial (177 hours), crewed
            missions that occurred entirely on the ground in June 1968.<br>
            <br>
            "2TV-1" stands for Block II Thermal Vacuum no. 1, and
            more-or-less describes the missions, which were to subject
            the spacecraft to vacuum and to thermal shock whilst the
            astronauts did astronauty things.<br>

              The Sundial software we have, unlike most of the AGC
              software on this site, does <i>not</i> come from program
              listings preserved in museums or private
              collections.&nbsp; Rather, the contents of physical
              core-rope modules in the AGC owned by the MIT Museum were
              dumped in July 2019, using <a href="Restoration.html">a
                restored, working AGC</a>.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
              As for the Sundial program itself, I do not have a good
              written description of it.&nbsp; It seems to me that it
              was used primarily for Command Module system tests,
              similar to the way the Aurora software (see our <a
                href="Luminary.html">LUMINARY page</a>) was used for the
              Lunar Modules.&nbsp; Sundial E in particular was in the
              test ropes used for the majority of Command Modules.<br>
              <br>
              Source code, not yet available, will be derived over the
              course of time from similar AGC programs, along with
              disassembly of portions of the rope not closely related to
              other AGC programs.&nbsp; At the moment, therefore, the
              software is accessibly only in its core-rope image form;
              i.e., it can only be run in the AGC simulation.<br>

            The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 237
            program listing was made available by original AGC developer
            Fred Martin.&nbsp; (Thanks, Fred!)&nbsp; The listing cuts
            off abruptly after page 1557—whereas you'd normally
            anticipate that there are 1700+ pages—so some of the
            assembler-generated tables at the end of the listing are
            missing.&nbsp; Of particular inconvenience, because it
            presents special problems for verifying the correctness of
            the simulation, is the absence of the octal listing and of
            the memory-bank checksums.&nbsp; However, all of the source
            code is present, and that's enough to work with.<br>
            <br>
            Note that we have <a
href="https://archive.org/details/Colossus237DigitalSimulationAnomaly45Images">a
              contemporary digital simulation of Colossus 237</a>,
            though it only covers a bailout during burn (Colossus
            Software Anomaly Report #45, of which we unfortunately don't
            presently have a copy).&nbsp; By "contemporary", I mean that
            it's an Apollo-era simulation, and not one produced by the
            Virtual AGC Project.&nbsp; It is the only Colossus digital
            simulation available so far, although there are a number of
            <a href="Luminary.html">Luminary</a> digital simulations in
            our library, and as such it has a unique value.&nbsp;
            Specifically, it has pad-loads, though those pad-loads are
            for March 1969 rather than for December 1968. <br>

              As for scanned image set #2, the marking on the front of
              the document implies that it was original AGC developer
              Norm Brodeur's copy.&nbsp; I originally obtained the scan
              from MIT's Dibner Institute's now-discontinued website
              titled "History of Recent Science and Technology."&nbsp;
              Here at Virtual AGC, I choose to present the listing as a
              set of individual page images instead of a giant
              PDF.&nbsp; This listing has been improved by the
              replacement of 52 garbled pages (supplied by Mr. Gary
              Neff).<br>
              <br>
              I have been told that the assembly listings, originally,
              could be printed either on "very noisy" line-printers with
              a restricted character set that happened to correspond to
              the character set allowed for the AGC programs themselves,
              or else on a page-printer that had a 256-character set,
              but in which the character set could be swapped out to
              allow different characters to be printed from the same
              numerical codes.&nbsp; All of the AGC printouts that are
              available to us are from the line printers, <i>except</i>
              this Colossus 249 printout, which was made on the page
              printer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the wrong character-set was
              set up on the printer when the printout was made, so that
              while all of the upper-case alphanumeric characters were
              printed correctly, many of the non-alphanumeric characters
              were systematically printed as different characters, in a
              kind of substitution cipher.&nbsp; The complete set of
              character-substitutions, in so far as I have been able to
              discern them, is as follows:<br>

            first software release of Comanche targeted for Apollo 10
            whose rope-memory modules were manufactured.&nbsp; It is <i>not</i>
            the version that was eventually flown in the mission.<br>
            <span id="moreCOMANCHE44" style="display:none"> <br>
              We know that Margaret Hamilton has a copy of this software
              version, and hope to get it from her some day.&nbsp; But
              that hasn't happened so far, and thus we do not have
              access to an original program listing.&nbsp; Why, then,
              have I provided a hyperlink to purported Colossus 44
              source code?<br>
              <br>
              The source code we provide has been <i>reconstructed</i>
              from existing source code for other versions of Colossus,
              with close consultation to contemporary documentation
              describing the changes between different versions of
              Colossus.&nbsp; Even though it's "merely" a
              reconstruction, we think the reconstructed source code is
              either exact, or else very, <i>very</i> close to the
              original.&nbsp; We can say that because there exists a
              contemporary document, <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n88/mode/1up">engineering




























                drawing 2021153</a>, that lists the correct memory-bank
              checksums for Colossus 44.&nbsp; Since the reconstructed
              program's memory-bank checksums match the listed ones, we
              thus have a pretty good feeling about the correctness of
              the reconstruction.&nbsp; It should still be noted that
              the contemporary change documentation consulted was
              neither 100% perfect nor complete, and thus there are
              still some questionable points in the reconstruction,
              particularly in log section P20-P25.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
              even if these minor details turn out later not to have
              been reconstructed 100% perfectly, we don't believe that
              they would adversely affect program execution.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              The reconstruction was carried out — brilliantly, in my
              (RSB) opinion — by Mike Stewart.&nbsp; He started from
              Comanche 51 — which he had <i>previously</i>
              reconstructed (<a href="#COMANCHE51">see below</a>) — and
              Colossus 249, while pulling snippets of code from various
              other versions of Colossus as well.&nbsp; If you want to
              learn how it was done, Mike's running commentary on how he
              did it can be found in <a

                report #1134</a> of our GitHub repository.<br>
              <br>
              AGC-software reconstructions of this kind would <i>normally</i>
              be subjected to the additional test of being flown in a
              simulated Apollo mission using the Orbiter/NASSP
              spacecraft simulator.&nbsp; (By the way, thanks to Nik
              Beug, who has flown these simulated missions a lot of
              times!)&nbsp; In the case of Comanche 44, however, Nik
              points out a problem:&nbsp; The software has a bug —
              relating to a broken interface between sub-programs P30
              and P40 — which would prevent it from operating properly
              using final Apollo 10 flight procedures as-is.&nbsp;
              Indeed, the presence of this bug is the very reason that
              Comanche 44 was originally obsoleted in favor of Comanche
              45 (see below).&nbsp; The broken interface was fixed in
              Comanche 45.&nbsp; Since the official flight procedure
              can't be used, Nik has expressed an understandable
              reduction of enthusiasm in flying Comanche 44. <img
                src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;
              But all is not lost!&nbsp; The plan is to next reconstruct
              Comanche 45 using Comanche 44 as a starting point ... and
              then presumably to test fly an Apollo 10 mission using
              Comanche 45, which would then indirectly serve as an
              additional validation of the Comanche 44
              reconstruction.&nbsp; So stay tuned for that.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              If, however, <i>you</i> would nevertheless like to fly a
              simulated Apollo 10 mission with Comanche 44 anyway, it
              should be possible to do so.&nbsp; That's because there is
              a workaround for the broken P30/40 interface, described in
              the original MIT/IL Software Anomaly Report (<a
                href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1136">see




























                here</a>) written in 1969 by AGC developer Fred
              Martin.&nbsp; In other words, you have to use the correct
              Apollo 10 procedures <i>plus</i> the workaround.&nbsp;
              The workaround reads as follows:<br>
              <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Avoidance




























                  Procedure:<br>
                  <br>

                <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">V4N1E<br>

                    3653E<br>
                  </font></blockquote>
                <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">then enter
                  quantity display in R<sub>2</sub> into R<sub>1</sub>;

              </blockquote>
              If you are able to successfully fly a simulated Apollo 10
              mission with Comanche 44 and this workaround, do let me
              know and I'll give you a shout out for posterity
              here!&nbsp; Make a video of the relevant portion of the
              simulated mission, and I'll include it here as well!<br>

            <span id="moreCOMANCHE45" style="display:none"> <br>
              As with Comanche 44, we have no program listing for this
              revision of the code.&nbsp; But Mike Stewart has
              reconstructed the code, starting from Comanche 44 (see
              above) and Comanche 51 (see below) as baselines.&nbsp;
              Fortunately, we actually had a certain amount of
              contemporary documentation, including a crucial Colossus
              memo (#140) and MIT Software Anomaly Reports, all included
              in <a
                href="Documents/Colossus%202%28A%29%20Software%20Changes.pdf#view=FitH">a
                nice little cache of phone snapshots</a> given to us by
              Debbie Douglas of the MIT Museum.&nbsp; There were
              actually only a couple of changes (literally 2 small
              blocks of code) from Comanche 44, but it turned out to be
              incredibly hard figuring out how to integrate them into
              Comanche 45.&nbsp; I can say that of my own [RSB]
              knowledge, since I spent around a week messing around with
              it full time.&nbsp; It's the first AGC software
              reconstruction effort I participated in directly, in a
              very minor way, as opposed to just providing commentary
              about it at the end of the process.&nbsp; It's a very
              impressive process, documented in detail <a
                href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1136">here</a>,
              and I think you can feel highly confident of the fidelity
              of the reconstruction to the original Comanche 45
              code.&nbsp; At least, <i>I</i> do.&nbsp; And of course,
              as is always the case with these reconstructions, the
              assembled core-rope module has checksums exactly matching
              the known-correct checksums for Comanche 45, and has been
              subjected to other cross-checks for consistency as well.<br>
              <br>
              Unlike the Comanche 44 code, the Comanche 45 code should
              be eminently flyable in a simulated Apollo 10 mission,
              without any need for workarounds that depart from the
              official procedures.&nbsp; However, why do that when you

            and final revision of Comanche for Apollo 10, and is the one
            actually flown in the mission.&nbsp; I should clarify that
            strictly speaking this is not a revision of
            "COMANCHE".&nbsp; Instead, it is a side development branch
            that split off from COMANCHE at COMANCHE 45, and is actually
            called "MANCHE45", thus if we had the printout of the
            original assembly listing (which we do not), at the tops of
            the pages it would say "REVISION 002 OF PROGRAM
            MANCHE45".&nbsp; The reason for this is that it allowed
            Apollo 10 development to continue with MANCHE45 rev 1 and
            rev 2 while Apollo 11 development was independently going on
            with COMANCHE 46, COMANCHE 47, etc.<br>

              <br>
              <b>Subsequent note</b>: About 9 months after the
              reconstruction mentioned above was completed, a user's
              manual for the GAP program was discovered.&nbsp; Recall
              that "GAP" stands for "General Assembler Program", and
              that it was the assembler (having superseded YUL) that was
              being used at the time of Apollo 10.&nbsp; Tucked away in
              an Appendix at the back of the user's manual is an example
              of how to use GAP's feature for listing octal differences
              between two core ropes.&nbsp; The numerical example
              happens to be a complete octal comparison of Comanche 45
              vs 45/2.&nbsp; In other words, if you happened to have a
              complete octal listing for Comanche 45, you could use this
              list of differences to immediately construct a complete
              octal listing for Comanche 45/2.&nbsp; Or vice
              versa.&nbsp; It turns out that the octal differences
              listed in that Appendix are precisely those differences
              between our reconstructions of Comanche 45 and 45/2.&nbsp;
              So if you need additional confidence in the accuracy of
              the reconstructions, beyond whatever confidence you feel
              due to the correct checksums, hopefully this will give it
              to you!&nbsp; Fortunately,&nbsp; the reconstruction of
              Comanche 45/2 from Comanche 45 seems to have been
              accomplished with very little time and effort ... at least
              compared to the vast amounts of time an heartache some of
              them need.&nbsp; So I'm happy — not having had to do the
              work myself! — that the reconstruction was performed
              before we found the list of octal differences.&nbsp; It
              makes you feel good that the reconstruction techniques
              proved to be so powerful.<br>

            subsequent revisions to the software before the mission
            occurred, so Comanche 51 never flew, and Comanche 55 (see

              We do not have a copy of one of the original Comanche 51
              program listings, but it turns out to be possible to
              reconstruct its source code with confidence.&nbsp; Mike
              Stewart (thanks, Mike!) has done so, and written up <a
                href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/pull/1080">an




























                explanation</a>.<br>
              <br>
              In brief, the explanation is this:&nbsp; We already had
              the source code for Comanche 55 (see below), and we knew
              that the difference between Comanche 51 and 55 was the
              addition of the so-called R-2 lunar potential model.&nbsp;
              Therefore, if the code for the R-2 lunar potential model
              were removed from the source code for Comanche 55, we
              should have the source code for Comanche 51.&nbsp;
              Fortunately, we have other AGC programs (Luminary) in
              which the R-2 change was made, so that example made the
              removal task much easier than it might have been
              otherwise.<br>
              <br>
              All of is great, but it sounds like pure
              speculation!&nbsp; There's no way to verify it,&nbsp;
              right?<br>
              <br>
              Fortunately, not right!&nbsp; We <i>do</i> have a way to
              verify the correctness of the reconstructed program,
              perhaps not with 100% certainty, but nevertheless fairly
              convincingly, with greater than 99.99% confidence.&nbsp;
              Because what I failed to mention is one additional
              resource, namely <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n88/mode/1up">engineering




























                drawing 2021153</a>.&nbsp; Drawing 2021153 is a list of
              the manufactured Comanche rope-memory modules, including
              Comanche 51.&nbsp; In addition to listing the software
              releases, it also lists all of the memory-bank checksums
              of the rope-memory as well.&nbsp; For example, it
              immediately tells us things, such as that of the 36 memory
              banks, only three of them have changed between Comanche 51
              and 55.<br>
              <br>
              More importantly, the reconstructed Comanche 51 source
              code, when assembled using the yaYUL assembler, does
              indeed produce a rope with all memory banks having the
              correct checksums as given by drawing 2021153.&nbsp; We
              conclude, therefore, that it is very likely correct source
              code!<br>

              included are function flow diagrams of the COLOSSUS
              programs and routines together with lists of verbs, nouns,

              second purpose is to provide the operational procedures

            13.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, it's not actually COMANCHE at
            all, but rather is a development branch called MANCHE72 that
            split off from COMANCHE at COMANCHE 72.&nbsp; The idea is
            that bug fixes or other changes strictly for Apollo 13 could
            be made in MANCHE72 rev 1, rev 2, and rev 3 while changes
            strictly for Apollo 14 could continue to be made
            independently in COMANCHE 73, COMANCHE 74, COMANCHE 75, and
            so on.&nbsp; This is a technique you use in
            strictly-controlled software to avoid unintentionally mixing
            in changes for one mission with those from another.&nbsp;
            You see, all changes have to be approved by a so-called
            "control board", and changes are typically approved for
            specific missions rather than willy-nilly giving blanket
            approvals that affect lots of missions at the same
            time.&nbsp; Thus if we were lucky enough to have a printout
            of the assembly listing (which we do not), at the tops of
            the pages it would say that this is "REVISION 003 OF PROGRAM
            MANCHE72", and would not mention COMANCHE at all.<br>
            <br>
            The good news is that if Comanche 72 can be reconstructed
            (see the entry above), then reconstruction of Comanche 72/3
            is highly likely.&nbsp; But it hasn't happened yet, so stay
            tuned.<br>

            <br>
            Although we don't presently have the Apollo 14 CM software,
            Niklas Beug, a developer and user of <a
              href="https://github.com/dseagrav/NASSP">NASSP, the
              Apollo-mission add-on for the Orbiter spaceflight
              simulator</a>, tells us that it's actually possible to use
            a modified form of Artemis (the Apollo 15-17 software) to
            fly satisfactory Apollo 14 missions.&nbsp; Let me simply
            quote Nik:<br>
            <blockquote><small>We currently don't have any AGC version
                available that was flown on Apollo 14, which causes a
                few, mostly procedural issues for NASSP. Apollo 14 was
                the only mission flown in the time period from July 1st,
                1970 to July 1st 1971 and as such used a slightly
                different coordinate system than the AGC versions before
                and after that. And using a different coordinate system
                means that a few hardcoded constants had to be changed
                every year: star unit vectors, solar and lunar ephemeris
                in the LGC and a few other numbers. These numbers for
                the yearly coordinate system used by Apollo 14 are
                available or can be calculated. So we did just that and
                created our own AGC versions for Apollo 14. Both CMC and
                LGC are derived from the AGC versions flown on Apollo
                15, Luminary 1E and Artemis (Colossus 3). We determined
                that these most closely match the programs and
                capabilities of the AGC versions actually flown on
                Apollo 14. One regular NASSP user (Alex Bart, ...)
                tested Apollo 14 with these modified AGC versions and
                flew the complete simulated mission with them. We are
                very confident now that these AGC versions are working
                as they should. As I said, they are essentially still
                the AGC versions flown on Apollo 15, only slightly
                modified to properly work with Apollo 14. ... <a

are




























                  available here</a>,
                as&nbsp;Artemis072NBY71.bin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Luminary210NBY71.bin,
                [i.e.] Artemis072 and Luminary210 modified to work for
                the Nearest Besselian Year (NBY) coordinate system of
                1971.</small><br>
            </blockquote>
            Unfortunately, "reconstruction" of the source code for
            Comanche 108 in a similar fashion to some of the other
            software versions you see in this table isn't very
            likely.&nbsp; The reason is that unlike the software
            versions which have been (or may yet be) reconstructed, we
            do <i>not</i> know the memory-bank checksums for Comanche
            108; thus even if by some chance the code were to be
            reconstructed perfectly, we still would not have any
            assurance whatever that the reconstruction was
            correct.&nbsp; And without that assurance, why would anyone
            use it rather than using Artemis?&nbsp; So there's little
            point even attempting a reconstruction other than as a pure
            intellectual puzzle.<br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, for all I know, a software listing or
            core-memory-module dump for Comanche 108 could suddenly
            appear, thus changing everything.&nbsp; That would be
            lovely.&nbsp; In lieu of that, with apologies to the
            Baroness Orczy,<br>
            <blockquote><i>We seek it here, w</i><i>e seek it there,</i><i><br>
              </i><i>We seek Comanche everywhere.</i><i><br>
              </i><i>Is it in Heaven?</i><i> — </i><i>Is it in Hell?</i><i><br>
              </i><i>It's a damned elusive ne'er-do-well!</i><br>

          <td valign="top"><a name="ARTEMIS71"></a>Artemis 71 was the
            first revision of Colossus targeted for Apollo 15.&nbsp; Its
            rope-memory modules were manufactured, but the program was
            subsequently revised and Artemis 72 instead flew in Apollo
            15 through 17.<br>
            <br>
            We do not have a copy of one of the original Artemis 71
            program listings, but it turns out to be possible to
            reconstruct its source code with confidence from the source
            code for Artemis 72.&nbsp; Mike Stewart (thanks, Mike!) has
            done so, and has provided <a
              href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1087">an




























              instructive full writeup</a> of how he figured it out.<br>
            <br>
            <span id="moreARTEMIS71" style="display:none"> <br>
              It turns out that in Artemis 71, there is a potential
              problem in program P15 (trans-lunar injection
              initiate/cutoff).&nbsp; That's the program that burns the
              S-IVB stage to put the CSM onto a trajectory to the
              moon.&nbsp; In P15, a double-precision variable used to
              track the remaining time of the S-IVB burn could exhibit a
              problem called sign disagreement.&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp;
              Well, it's a quirk of how AGC double-precision and
              triple-precision arithmetic works that can't occur in the
              modern computers you're familiar with.&nbsp; Sign
              disagreement is when the more-significant and
              less-significant halves of a double-precision value have
              opposite arithmetical signs.&nbsp; For example, the top
              half might be -12345 and bottom half might be +67890 ...
              whereas it would normally be expected that they would be
              -12345 and -67890.&nbsp; Thus in Artemis 72, the potential
              problem was fixed by inserting an extra subroutine call
              that could detect the problem and fix the sign of the
              bottom word.<br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately, we have no COLOSSUS memo or other
              documentation that independently describes this problem or
              that lists the differences between Artemis 71 and 72, so
              everything that was said above can only be inferred from
              the clues in the Artemis 72 assembly listing described by
              Mike in his writeup.&nbsp; Fortunately, we <i>do</i> have
              an independent way to verify the correctness of the
              reconstructed Artemis 71 program, with greater than 99.99%
              confidence.&nbsp; That's because we have <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/apertureCardBox467Part2NARASW_images#page/n93/mode/1up">engineering




























                drawing 2021154</a>.&nbsp; Drawing 2021154 is a list of
              the manufactured Artemis rope-memory modules.&nbsp; While
              we don't have the final revision of drawing 2021154, the
              revision we have does include Artemis 71, and lists the
              memory-bank checksums for its rope memory.&nbsp; 3 memory
              banks (out of 36 total) in Artemis 71 have checksums
              differing from Artemis 72.<br>
              <br>
              The reconstructed Artemis 71 source code, when assembled
              using the yaYUL assembler, does indeed produce a rope with
              all memory banks having the correct checksums as given by
              drawing 2021154.&nbsp; We can feel confident that it is
              very likely correct source code!<br>

      In other words, to create a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
      binary executable rather than using the one provided with yaAGC
      (such as Colossus249.bin), one simply needs to assemble the file
      MAIN.agc.&nbsp; Typically, if all files remain organized the way
      they are in the yaAGC distribution tarball, the sequence of steps
      for doing so (from a command-line prompt) would be something like
      this:<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <br>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Colossus249</span><br
          style="font-family: monospace;">

          &gt;Colossus249.lst</span><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The binary so produced, MAIN.agc.bin, should be byte-for-byte
      identical to the binary (Colossus249.bin) provided with the yaAGC
      distribution.&nbsp; Therefore, the following Linux command should
      reveal no differences between the two<br>
      <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
          monospace;">diff MAIN.agc.bin Colossus249.bin</span><br>

              A point which may not be completely appreciated is that
              Colossus249.bin was <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
              created from the assembly-language source files.&nbsp;
              Therefore, the byte-for-byte equivalence mentioned above
              actually has some significance.&nbsp; In fact, both the
              assembly-language source code and Colossus249.bin (or
              Colossus249.binsource) come from separate readings of the
              original <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
              assembly listing scan, so their equivalence provides an
              important check on validity.&nbsp; (See below.)&nbsp; The
              file Colossus249.bin was created from the
              human-readable/editable ASCII file Colossus249.binsource
              by means of the program <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oct2Bin</span>,
              with the following steps:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span

              Admittedly, few people are likely to perform any

      <h2><a name="Validity"></a>Validation</h2>
      I generally put a lot of effort into insuring that the executable
      binaries being run in the simulated AGC are byte-for-byte (or in
      the case of the AGC, word-for-word) identical to the original
      binaries used in the spacecraft.&nbsp; Most people won't be
      interested in this validation effort at all—just as we're not
      usually interested in how food gets from plants and animals onto
      the plates in front of us as long as we get our dinners on time;
      we're happy to trust others to do the work for us—but for those
      few of you who wonder if the simulated AGC really is running the
      correct code, the following sections provide explanations.&nbsp;
      The different program versions are presented in the order in which
      they were worked on.<br>
      <h3><a name="ValidityApollo9"></a>Validity of the Colossus 249
        Code (Apollo 9)<br>
      </h3>
      The following description of validation was written prior to
      having the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus249</span>
      software source code in machine-readable form, and therefore prior
      to being able to the core-rope image against the source code as
      described above.&nbsp; Not only that, but there were seven errors
      in the core-rope not detected by the procedure described below!<br>
      <br>
      So the description is now obsolete.&nbsp; But I like it, and it's
      my website, so it stays.&nbsp; (Actually, it continues to have
      value, since we don't yet have all versions of the AGC source, and
      since it describes how to proceed in the case of recovering
      poor-quality assembly listings.)<br>
      <h4><a name="A_Tour_of_the_Source_Materials"></a>A Tour of the
        Source Materials</h4>
      Let's look at a pages from the <a
        href="ScansForConversion/Colossus249/0200.pdf"> source materials</a>
      (actually, a greatly improved version) I've used in reconstructing
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> 1A (build
      249).&nbsp; In appearance, what we have is a <span
        style="font-style: italic;">scan</span> of a <span
        style="font-style: italic;">photocopy</span> of an <span
        style="font-style: italic;">assembly listing</span> of the
      program.&nbsp; Significant portions of the assembly listing have
      been corrupted (or even destroyed) after scanning, seemingly by
      processing with the optical-character-recognition capabilities of
      Adobe Acrobat.&nbsp; (The <a
        href="ScansForConversion/Luminary131/0202.jpg"> source materials</a>
      used for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> 1C,
      build 131, are generally similar, except that the original
      photocopy seems to be of better quality, the scans seem to have
      been performed with much more care, and no destructive
      post-processing has been performed.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
      original <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
      printout seems to have been on computer paper with green and white
      color bars, and the remnants of the green bars make portions of
      the listing very difficult to read with certainty.&nbsp; Most of
      what I have to say will apply to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
      as well as to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>.)&nbsp;
With




























      some luck, I'll be able to find (or will be given) better source
      materials at some point in the future, but I've had no luck so far
      in obtaining such materials and therefore have had to make do with
      what's available.<br>
      <br>
      An <span style="font-style: italic;">assembly listing</span> is a
      type of report created when a program's source code is processed
      ("assembled"), in this case by the assembler program called <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>.&nbsp; (Actually, by <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">GAP</span>, the successor to <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>, but when I say "YUL" I
      really mean "either YUL or GAP".)&nbsp; Such an assembly listing
      contains not only a listing of the source code, but also other
      helpful information such as the octal values which the source code
      assembles to.&nbsp; The octal codes are what is needed to <span
        style="font-style: italic;">run</span> the program, while the
      source code is what is needed to <span style="font-style:
        italic;">modify</span> the program.&nbsp; The general layout of
      the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> (or <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>) assembly listing has
      a series of sections, of which some of the more interesting are:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A listing of the source code, side by side with the octal
          codes created from the source code, side by side with the
          addresses at which the octal values are placed.&nbsp; <a
            href="853.pdf">Click here</a> to see a typical page (without
          OCR).&nbsp; The source code is on the right-hand side of the
          page, whereas the octal values, addresses, and other
          miscellaneous notations are on the left-hand side of the
          page.&nbsp; This section occupies about 1500 pages of the
          assembly listing.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A symbol table, giving the addresses at which all of the
          symbols created by the program are defined.</li>
        <li>An octal listing, which is the same as the octal values
          shown earlier side by side with the source code, but now
          rearranged so that the values are arranged by memory
          address.&nbsp; <a href="1714.pdf">Click here</a> to see a
          typical page (without OCR).&nbsp; This section occupies about
          150 pages of the source listing.<br>
        </li>
        <li>An octal-to-page cross reference, in which you can find the
          page of the assembly listing at which the octal value for any
          given address is defined.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><a name="Proofing_in_the_Usual_Case"></a>Proofing in the Usual
        Case</h4>
      From the description above, you will have noted that source code
      is listed once within the assembly listing, but that octal values
      created from the source code are listed <span style="font-style:
        italic;">twice</span>, and are therefore redundant.&nbsp;
      Furthermore, knowing the source code, one can recreate the octal
      values from it.&nbsp; (The reverse is not as easy.)&nbsp; Finally,
      the octal listing is much shorter than the source-code
      listing.&nbsp; Therefore, it shouldn't be surprising that it is
      much easier to create a file containing a valid octal listing of
      the program than it is to create a file containing a valid
      source-code listing.<br>
      <br>
      It is also much easier to <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span>
      that an octal listing is valid than it is to know that a
      source-code listing is valid.&nbsp; This is true because the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span> assembler has added
      "checksums" to the octal values, which can be used to verify (or
      at least give a high degree of confidence) that the octal values
      are correct.&nbsp; The way this works is that the so-called "fixed
      memory" of the AGC has been divided into 36 banks, numbered 0-43
      in octal notation, each of which has a 15-bit checksum created by
      adding up all of the 15-bit words within the bank.&nbsp;
      (Actually, the rule for computing the checksum is more
      complicated, but that's the basic idea.)&nbsp; Therefore, if we
      compute the checksum of a bank and see that it is the same as the
      checksum provided by <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>,
      we can be fairly confident that the contents of the bank are
      correct.&nbsp; (I should mention that I've provided a utility
      called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oct2Bin</span> which is
      helpful in this connection.&nbsp; Octal codes can be placed in a
      simple ASCII file, and then processed with <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Oct2Bin</span> to create a file
      containing the actual octal/binary codes and to verify all bank
      checksums.)<br>
      <br>
      Another helpful touch added by <span style="font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>
      is that each octal value is accompanied by a <span
        style="font-style: italic;">parity bit</span>, contrived to make
      the number of 1-bits within the octal value (including the parity
      bit) an odd number.&nbsp; This is useful in detecting single digit
      errors of some kinds.&nbsp; (The digits 0, 3, 5, and 6 have <span
        style="font-style: italic;">even parity</span>, while the digits
      1, 2, 4, and 7 have <span style="font-style: italic;">odd parity</span>.&nbsp;
Therefore,




























      examination of the parity bit could detect substitution of a '2'
      for a '3', for example, but not substitution of a '5' for a '6'.)<br>
      <br>
      In almost all cases, the following simple procedure suffices to
      produce a valid octal listing:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Manually proof-read a memory bank of the octal listing
          against the original assembly listing, using the redundancy of
          the octal values or manually assembling source code as
          necessary to account for corrupted areas of the assembly
          listing.</li>
        <li>Compute and verify the checksum.</li>
        <li>On failure, go back to step 1.&nbsp; On success do the next
          memory bank.</li>
      </ol>
      Given a valid octal listing, determining the validity of a <span
        style="font-style: italic;">source-code</span> listing is rather
      trivial:&nbsp; simply run the source code through the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> assembler, and verify
      that the same octal listing is produced.<br>
      <br>
      This procedure in fact suffices for the entire <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> octal listing, and
      for all memory banks of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
      except banks 35 and 36 (octal).&nbsp; If you want to learn more
      about proofing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
      memory banks 35 and 36, read onward.&nbsp; Otherwise, quit now!<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Postscript</span>:&nbsp; After
      writing all of the material below, I was fortunate enough to
      receive some much-improved page scans of relevant portions of bank
      36 from Mr. Gary Neff.&nbsp; Therefore, bank 36 is now capable of
      being proofed by the simple method explained above.&nbsp; However,
      it was previously proofed using the much more complex methods
      explained below, and therefore I haven't bothered to change the
      explanation that follows.<br>
      <h4><a name="Proofing_in_Extraordinary_Cases_"></a>Proofing in
        Extraordinary Cases<br>
      </h4>
      The simple proofing method outlined above fails when the scan of
      the assembly listing for some memory bank is <span
        style="font-style: italic;">so</span> corrupted that the bank
      checksum or some value(s) within the memory bank are completely
      unknown.&nbsp; Sadly, this condition occurs within <span

      35 and 36.&nbsp; <a href="1713.pdf">Click here</a> to see the
      culprit page of the octal listing.&nbsp; This corrupted page from
      the octal listing actually wads together the end of bank 35 and
      the beginning of bank 36 in such a way that there is no chance of
      figuring out any but a small part of them.&nbsp; In this case, one
      has no choice but to use the redundant listing of the octal values
      that appears side by side with the source code.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, though, the redundant octal values in the source
      code listing fail us here, though in different ways for bank 35
      and bank 36.&nbsp; For bank 35, we encounter the problem that the
      bank checksum appears <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
      within the octal listing and is not redundant.&nbsp; Therefore, we
      can theoretically know all of the octal values in the memory
      bank—if our proofing is 100% accurate—but cannot use the bank
      checksum to give us the degree of confidence we would like.&nbsp;
      For bank 36, the checksum is intact but some of the octal values
      cannot be directly determined because of corruption within the
      source-code listing.&nbsp; (In other words, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">both</span> the octal listing and
      the source-code listing are corrupted in the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">corresponding place</span>.)&nbsp;
      As far as proofing is concerned, however, the conclusion is the
      same:&nbsp; We need some method of proofing which gives us a high
      level of confidence in the result, in the absence of a checksum.<br>
      <br>
      Here is the alternate method of proofing used in this cases, which
      seems to offer a fairly high level of confidence:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Note first that each memory bank actually occupies 4 pages
          within the octal listing.&nbsp; For this method, we proof each
          memory page separately from the others.</li>
        <li>Manually proof-read the memory page, using either the octal
          listing or the source-code listing as desired or
          appropriate.&nbsp; While doing so, record the number of digits
          which have been corrected.</li>
        <li>Repeat step 2 until zero corrections have been made in two
          successive proofings.</li>
        <li>To the extent feasible, one of the 0-error proofings should
          use the octal listing, and the other should use the
          source-code listing.</li>
      </ol>
      The theory behind this procedure is that in any given proofing a
      certain percentage of errors is corrected, and that by monitoring
      the number of errors that have been corrected we can get a good
      sense of the number of errors remaining.&nbsp; To take a "typical"
      case, suppose that on the first proofing 100 errors are detected
      and corrected, on the second proofing 1 error is detected and
      corrected, and on the third and fourth proofings 0 errors are
      detected.&nbsp; It would be reasonable to suppose that each
      proofing pass detects 99% of errors, so the expected number of
      errors remaining after the 4th pass is 100*0.01*0.01*0.01*0.01, or
      about a millionth of an error.&nbsp; Of course, this reasoning
      assumes that our ability to detect and correct different errors
      has some quality of statistical independence, and that errors are
      not remaining undetected through some systematic problem.&nbsp; We
      try to overcome that objection by making sure that we use both the
      octal listing and the source-code listing in the proofing process,
      but how successful we have been is always debatable.<br>
      <br>
      As far as proofing is concerned, this technique suffices for <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> banks 35 and 36, but
      does not actually give us a 100% knowledge of the octal values
      within the banks.&nbsp; For bank 35, we can simply construct a
      checksum and be done with it.&nbsp; But for bank 36, we need to do
      a little more work.&nbsp; If you want to know more about that,
      read onward!<br>

      </h4>
      In a case like bank 36, the technique above may give us confidence
      that all octal values that are legible in the page images are
      keyed accurately, but the proofing technique can't give us any
      insight into the octal values that are simply missing from both
      the source-code listing and the octal listing.&nbsp; One trick we
      can try is to compare the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> source-code,
      which actually have a high degree of overlap in general.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, this is not a case in which there is any such
      overlap, so the comparison is of no help.<br>

      relevant to the problems in bank 36, namely:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Address 36,2634:&nbsp; This source-code line is simply
          missing.&nbsp; We have no clue as to what may have been in it,
          except that it is seemingly the <span style="font-style:
            italic;">first</span> part of a double-precision constant
          whose <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span> part is
          the word 00000 octal.</li>
        <li>Address 36,2734:&nbsp; Appears to be interpretive code
          reading "<span style="font-style: italic;">something1
            something2</span>", but only a couple of pixel rows are
          present, and so neither the octal code nor the
          assembly-language code can be read.</li>
        <li>Address 36,2742:&nbsp; Highly corrupted, but <span
            style="font-style: italic;">may</span> have the octal code
          00021 and <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> have
          interpretive source code reading "16D".</li>
        <li>Address 36,2747:&nbsp; Pretty corrupted, but seems likely to
          be the interpretive source code "CALL" with octal code 77624.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      As far as points 3 and 4 are concerned, I think it's pretty easy
      to convince ourselves that the proposed interpretations are
      probably correct.&nbsp; If you want a challenge, you may like to
      try solving problems 1 and 2 for yourself, before continuing to
      read my proposed solution below.<br>
      <br>
      Point 2 is somewhat trickier than problems 3 and 4, because the
      corruption of the page-image is so much greater.&nbsp; But with
      some effort, we can still figure it out.&nbsp; Within the <a
        href="851.pdf">offending page</a> of the source-code listing,
      notice the notations "REF" and "LAST".&nbsp; These notations
      appear only on source-code lines referencing variables.&nbsp;
      "REF" gives the number of times the variable has been referred to
      so far in the assembly listing, which "LAST" gives the page number
      on which the preceeding reference occurred.&nbsp; The problematic
      source line clearly contains REF and LAST notations (even though
      we cannot read them), and so it is clear that <span
        style="font-style: italic;">something2</span> is the name of a
      variable.&nbsp; You should be able to convince yourself fairly
      easily that the variable in question is <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">RCON</span>.&nbsp; In other words, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">something2</span>="<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">RCON</span>".&nbsp; (In case
      it's still not obvious <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span>
      you would convince yourself of this, note that "REF 6" to <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">RCON</span> is below the missing
      source line, while "REF 4" is on the preceding page, but that "REF
      5" is nowhere to be found.)&nbsp; Next, because this section of
      code is AGC interpreter language (rather than assembly language),
      we can narrow down the choices for <span style="font-style:
        italic;">something1</span>; theoretically, the only
      possibilities are <span style="font-family: monospace;">STORE</span>,
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">STODL</span>, or <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">STOVL</span>.&nbsp; Simply in
      terms of appearances, it seems likely that <span
        style="font-style: italic;">something1</span>=<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">STODL</span>.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, the interpreter documentation (<a
        href="hrst/archive/1687.pdf"><span style="font-style: italic;">Users
Guide




























          to the Block II AGC/LGC Interpreter</span></a>, by Charles A.
      Muntz) was last updated in early 1965, and contains an incorrect
      numerical opcode for <span style="font-family: monospace;">STODL</span>.&nbsp;




























      Not to be deterred, though, if we look at the other source-code
      lines near the missing line, we see intact lines like "<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">STODL RPRE,</span>" (the comma
      after "<span style="font-family: monospace;">RPRE</span>", by the
      way, is actually part of the variable name), from which we can
      deduce that the octal code for <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">STODL</span> is 16000.&nbsp; Noting that <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">RCON</span> has the address
      1635, therefore, "<span style="font-family: monospace;">STODL RCON</span>"
      must assemble to the octal code 16000+1635+1=17636.&nbsp; But—and
      why, I'd like to know, does there always seem to be <span
        style="font-style: italic;">another</span> "but"?—the missing
      line of code is preceded by a line of source code reading simply "<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">STADR</span>".&nbsp; The <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">STADR</span> opcode has the odd
      effect of complementing the code that follows it.&nbsp;
      Therefore—finally!—the missing octal code for address 36,2734 is
      probably 60141.&nbsp; This closely matches the remaining pixel
      fragments (and expected parity bit) of the missing line, and so we
      can feel good about it.<br>
      <br>
      Having now determined all of the octal values within the bank
      except at address 36,2634, and noting the checksum for bank 36 is
      known, we can consider the possibility of recreating the octal
      value at 36,2634 simply by putting a value there that correctly
      reproduces the bank's checksum.&nbsp; This is actually trickier
      than you may suppose, since the checksum is unique only up to a
      sign.&nbsp; (In other words, we don't know whether to insert a
      value that produces the positive checksum or one that produces the
      negative checksum.)&nbsp; Often, either the positive or the
      negative checksum will be impossible to produce, thus removing the
      uncertainty.&nbsp; Where it is possible to produce both the
      positive and the negative checksum, we note that 90% of the memory
      banks have positive checksums, so we have a much better chance of
      being correct if we choose the positive checksum.&nbsp;&nbsp; All
      of this turns out to be an anti-climax, however:&nbsp; Prior to
      any of the reasoning listed above, our inclination was simply to
      put 00000 at address 36,2634.&nbsp; Remarkably, this produces the
      correct bank checksum without any additional work on our
      part!&nbsp; Perhaps this is the first time in history that a gut
      reaction has been confirmed by checksum.<br>

      After the all of the intricate reasoning above was worked out—and
      the description above written—Mr. Gary Neff was able to send me
      some terrific replacement scans of the problematic
      assembly-listing pages from bank 36, namely pp. 846-847.&nbsp; If
      you examine locations 36,2634, 36, 2734, 36,2742, and 36,2747 on
      the new scan, you'll see that they indeed contain exactly the
      values deduced above!&nbsp; I still think the exploration I went
      through before receiving the new scans is a valuable illustration
      of technique, not to mention being soothing to my ego, so I'll
      leave it in place for future generations to enjoy.&nbsp; :-)<br>
      <h3><a name="ValidityApollo11"></a>Validity of the Comanche 055
        Code (Apollo 11)<br>
      </h3>
      The Comanche 055 page images became available after the Colossus
      249 and Luminary 131page images had already been converted to
      source-code files, and prior to any other missions becoming
      available.&nbsp; The conversion technique was very abbreviated
      compared to that of Colossus 249, as follows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A small corps of volunteers—thanks (in alphabetical order)
          Fabrizio Bernardini, Hartmuth Gutshe, Onno Hommes, Jim Lawton,
          and Sergio Navarro!—took the existing Colossus 249 source-code
          files, or on occasion the Luminary 131 source-code files, and
          laboriously compared them line-by-line to the Comanche 055
          assembly-listing page images, porting the differences they
          found.</li>
        <li>The resulting Comanche 055 source code was assembled using <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> to produce a binary
          executable, which was horribly wrong at this point (with
          dozens of conversion errors), but was used to create a
          "binsource" file (which is an octal listing of the entire
          program).</li>
        <li>The binsource file was laboriously proofed against the octal
          listing in the page images (this time by me), and
          corrected.&nbsp; As a double-check, the bank checksums are all
          correct.</li>
        <li>Finally, at every point where the binary created from the
          source code by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
          differed from the binsource file, the source code was compared
          to the page images and corrected.&nbsp; After all corrections
          were made, the binary created by <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">yaYUL</span> was identical to the binary created from
          the binsource file.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The binary thus produced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
      is supplied in the source tree and used for regression testing.<br>
      <h3><a name="ValiditySource15"></a>Validity of Artemis 072 Code
        (Apollo 15-17)</h3>
      The Artemis 072 executable (Artemis072.bin) was created by
      manually entering binary data from scans of an Artemis 072
      assembly listing.&nbsp; The data was proofed and reproofed until
      the bank checksums, as described above, were correct, and the
      binary was made available to the public on 2006-01-10.&nbsp; On
      2010-02-20 (more than 4 years later), source code was finally
      available and assembled.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:
        underline;">A single error</span> <span style="font-style:
        italic; text-decoration: underline;">which did not affect the
        memory-bank checksum</span> <span style="text-decoration:
        underline;">was found</span> and corrected in the binary.&nbsp;
      So we are <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span> confident
      that what is being provided is both complete and correct.<br>
      <br>
      This is an interesting object lesson.&nbsp; My previous notes in
      this section, prior to the availability of source code, made it
      clear that I wouldn't be surprised if additional pairs or even
      triplets of errors were found in the binary ... but the notion
      that an unpaired error might still exist which did not affect the
      checksum never occurred to me.&nbsp; The problem is a weakness in
      the checksumming algorithm used in the AGC.<br>
      <br>
      If the AGC had used a "normal" checksumming algorithm (from the
      modern point of view) with 2's-complement arithmetic, any <span
        style="font-style: italic;">single</span> error in data would
      have caused the checksum to change, and the error to be detected.<br>
      <br>
      But in the 1's-complement arithmetic of the AGC, simple
      checksumming does not have the same desirable property.&nbsp; For
      example, since there is both a +0 and a -0, which produce the same
      result in an addition, a memory error in which +0 is replaced by
      -0 (or vice versa) produces the same checksum and would be
      undetectable.&nbsp; But algorithmically the problem is more
      complicated than that, since a simple checksum algorithm was not
      used.&nbsp; The actual algorithm used on a data-word by data-word
      basis was this:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>The next data word is added to the running checksum.</li>
        <li>If there is <span style="font-style: italic;">positive</span>
          overflow, the result is reduced by 040000 (considered as a
          positive number, thus preserving the sign of the result) and
          then incremented.</li>
        <li>if there is <span style="font-style: italic;">negative</span>
          overflow, the result is incremented by 040000 (again,
          considered as a positive number, thus preserving the sign of
          the result), and then decremented.</li>
      </ul>
      For example, if the running checksum was 030000 (a positive
      number), and the next data word was 020000 (another positive
      number), then adding them would give 050000 (arithmetic
      overflow!), which would be decremented (due to the overflow) by
      040000 to give 010000, and then incremented by 1 to give a running
      checksum of 010001.<br>
      <br>
      If you are amused by such stuff, I invite you to consider the ways
      in which such an algorithm might fail to detect error.&nbsp; In
      the case of the Artemis 72 binary, the now-corrected error was a <span
        style="font-style: italic;">single bit</span> (the most
      significant bit) of a single memory location.<br>
      <h3><a name="ValidityApollo8"></a>Validity of Colossus 237 (Apollo
        8)</h3>
      The Colossus 237 program listing presented a special challenge,
      because the only physical copy we've had access to is
      truncated.&nbsp; It contains all of the source code, as well as
      the binary words associated with the source code on a line-by-line
      basis.&nbsp; But it is missing the octal listing that condenses
      all of the binaries into an easily accessible form.&nbsp; Because
      the octal listing is missing, the "bugger words" that are used to
      make the memory-bank checksums compute correctly are also
      missing.&nbsp; Thus, important redundancies and checksums that
      normally would be used to provide confidence of correctness are
      missing.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the following unique validation procedure was applied
      instead:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A "binsource" file was created by laboriously stepping
          through the page images of the program listing, line-by-line,
          and observing the listed binary words.&nbsp; The "bugger
          words" are not available in this fashion, and are therefore
          left at zero.</li>
        <li>Since Colossus 237 and Colossus 249 are separated in time by
          only a few months, the binsource files of Colossus 237 and
          Colossus 249 — i.e., the binary files we create manually,
          independently of the source listings, as part of the
          data-entry process — were compared using automated tools
          ('diff' or similar).&nbsp; Where differences existed, the page
          images of the Colossus 237 program listing were referenced to
          verify (to the extent possible) that the differences were real
          rather than being transcription errors.&nbsp;<br>
        </li>
        <li>Where complete memory banks were found to be identical by
          the automated comparison, the bugger words were copied from
          Colossus 249 to Colossus 237.</li>
        <li>Source-code files were created from the page images of the
          program listing.</li>
        <li>The binary of the assembled source-code files was compared
          in an automated fashion against the binary created from the
          binsource file, and either the binsource file or the source
          code (or both) were corrected when any discrepancies were
          found.&nbsp; At this stage of the process, validation process,
          it is very typical for "superbank" errors to show up; these
          are errors not in the source code <i>per se</i>, but are due
          to discrepancies between <b>yaYUL</b>'s assumptions about the
          superbank memory settings in comparison to the assumptions of
          the original YUL or GAP assemblers; thus, those superbank
          problems were corrected as well.<br>
        </li>
        <li>For any banks remaining without bugger words in the
          binsource file, the bugger words created by <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> were added.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus while we can't have as much confidence in the validity of
        the Colossus 237 transcription, in comparison to almost all of
        the other Colossus and Luminary transcriptions, the code has
        nevertheless been double-checked both manually (visually) and in
        an automated fashion as well.<br>

      Solarium 055 presented a big challenge because it is the first
