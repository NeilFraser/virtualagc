        id="What_is_the_Gemini_Spacecraft_Computer_"></a>What is the
      Gemini Spacecraft Computer (OBC)?<br>
    </h2>
    The Gemini spacecraft computer is, as the name implies, the onboard
    computer of the Gemini spacecraft.&nbsp; The computer seems to have
    been referred to variously as the "spacecraft computer", the
    "digital computer", or the "On-Board Computer" (OBC).&nbsp;&nbsp; It
    was the Gemini equivalent of Apollo's AGC, though with more limited
    capabilities and functionality.&nbsp; Its basic use was in the
    post-launch phases of missions (orbit phase, retrograde phase,
    re-entry phase), because the Titan II rocket which carried the
    Gemini spacecraft into orbit was guided by its own (separate) ACS-15
    guidance computer, but there was provision also for switchover to
    the Gemini computer for backup guidance if the need arose.&nbsp;
    Interestingly, the OBC could be used for automatic attitude control
    of the spacecraft, but not automatic velocity control; rather, it
    performed necessary calculations for maneuvers such as orbital
    insertion or re-entry, and the pilots then performed the manual
    chores of actually adjusting the spacecraft velocity appropriately.<br>
    <br>
    The OBC was designed and manufactured by IBM's Federal Systems
    Division, in Owego, New York, just as Apollo's <a href="LVDC.html">Launch









      Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC)</a> was.&nbsp; The OBC and the
    LVDC are extraordinarily similar at the CPU level.<br>

    From a user standpoint, the most visible of the OBC's peripheral
    device was the Manual Data Insertion Unit (MDIU)—the Gemini
    equivalent of the Apollo <a href="yaDSKY.html">DSKY</a>—which
    comprised the Modular Display Keyboard (MDK) and the Modular Display

        The IMU is the usual gimballed stable platform with
        accelerometers and angular resolvers as in Apollo, except for a
        key difference that the Gemini IMU had four gimbals rather than
        the three gimbals of Apollo.&nbsp; This means that it was not
        subject to the phenomenon of "gimbal lock", and hence the
        software used to adjust spacecraft alignment could be simpler
        than with three gimbals.&nbsp; The value of the 4th gimbal can
        be appreciated when considering incidents like the mishap in
        Gemini VIII in which an uncontrolled roll occurred.&nbsp; (If
        the IMU had had only three gimbals, my understanding is that
        gimbal lock would have occurred when the roll angle was too
        great.)&nbsp; On the other hand, at that point the spacecraft
        was under manual control anyway, and I'm sure that the notion
        that the IMU would have to be realigned later would have been
        the least of Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott's worries.<br>

      Documentation</h2>
    Sadly, documentation we've been able to collect for the OBC lags far
    behind that of the AGC or even that of the Abort Guidance System
    (AGS).&nbsp; What little survives that we have been able to access
    can be found in our <a href="links2.html#OBC">Document Library</a>.&nbsp;





    There's a lot of unique stuff there contributed by original Gemini
    developers.<br>
    <br>
    Of particular note are the portions of the <i>Gemini Operations
      Handbook</i>, for spacecraft 7 and 10, and especially subsection
    2.5.7 of those handbooks.&nbsp; These provide user instructions for
    the flight-computer software, and in the case of spacecraft 10 are
    particularly detailed.&nbsp; For example, in the case of spacecraft
    10, there's a complete list, with explanations, scope, and format,
    of all of the memory variables (addresses 0-162) accessible from the
    MDIU/DCS.<br>

      "What is software, my man?&nbsp; What is software?"<br>
    </h2>
    Information about the Gemini OBC software is hard to come by.&nbsp;
    Useful information we <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span>
    have includes any actual OBC software that's contemporary to the
    Gemini project itself, and that's a lot not to know.&nbsp; But the
    situation isn't all bad, partly because the development method of
    the Gemini OBC software causes us to question what the notion of
    having the original software even means.&nbsp; I'll explain more
    about that shortly, but there's an important sense in which we
    actually do have significant portions of the software at our
    disposal.<br>
    <br>
    But before turning our attention to such lofty matters, let's begin
    with some of the more-mundane details.&nbsp; Firstly, as far as
    naming is concerned, the flight software seems to have been called
    simply the "operational program".&nbsp;&nbsp; On the subject of
    versioning of the operational program, we have only partial
    information, from the familiarization manual, from <a
      href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/computers/Ch1-3.html">James
Tomayko's









      Computers in Spaceflight, Chapter 1, section 4</a>, and from <a
      href="Documents/GeminiSoftwareHistory.pdf"> this short memo</a>.&nbsp;








    (Where there's any discrepancy, I personally believe in the memo.)<br>
    <br>
    The operational programs were characterized in terms of something
    called the "Math Flow".&nbsp; In brief, the Math Flow is the
    complete design of the software, expressed in Gemini as a series of
    very detailed flowcharts.&nbsp; The development of the Math Flow
    eventually went through 7 major versions, designated MF-1 through
    MF-7.&nbsp; But there were differing revisions for each of the major
    versions as well.<br>
    <br>
    The overall software design was partitioned into several different
    areas of basic functionality. In math-flow MF-1 through MF-6, these
    functional areas were integrated into a single operational
    program.&nbsp; (Though for some missions, unneeded functionality
    could be omitted. Thus, Catch-up &amp; Rendezvous were omitted in
    spacecraft GT-3, GT-4, and GT-7.)&nbsp; In MF-7, the code was
    refactored into 6 different high-level "Program Modules", which
    could be loaded into memory from the <a
      href="Gemini.html#Auxiliary_Tape_Memory_ATM">Auxiliary Tape Memory
      (ATM)</a> when needed during specific mission phases, though
    Module I was in memory at all times and didn't need to be loaded
    from the ATM.&nbsp; The modules were as follows:<br>

    amount the following mission phases to indirectly affect the active
    functionality areas:&nbsp; Pre-launch, Ascent, Catch-up, Rendezvous,
    or Re-entry.<br>
    <br>
    All of these functionality areas are self-explanatory, except
    "Executor".&nbsp; Executor is the interface that interrelates the
    other software modules and allows them to interact with each other,
    as well has implementing certain common functionality among them.<br>

    Finally, let's return to odd question of whether or not we're in
    possession of any of the original flight software.&nbsp; This
    question is related to the serious if somewhat facetiously-phrased
    question asked in this title's heading, namely:&nbsp; "What is
    software?"&nbsp; In the context of the Virtual AGC project --- and I
    think in the minds of most currently-active computer programmers
    (2011) --- the question "What is software?" is very easily
    answered:&nbsp; If you have the source code of the program (and some
    way of compiling or assembling that code) or if you have the binary
    executable of the program (and some way to execute it), then you
    have the software.&nbsp; If you have all of the instructions for how
    to compile/assemble it, so much the better.&nbsp; But the OBC
    software developers had a somewhat different view of this question,
    and their view is bound up in the method used to develop the
    software.<br>
    <br>
    The most important thing to understand about the
    software-development process for the OBC software is that it was
    very heavily dependent on design as opposed to coding.&nbsp; What I
    mean by that is the following:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Great attention was given to deriving the mathematics needed
        for achieving the objectives, and great attention was given as
        well to verifying the correctness of that mathematics.</li>
      <li>Then (and only then), great attention was given to developing
        the "Math Flow".&nbsp; To repeat what I said earlier, the Math
        Flow was a series of a flowcharts specifying the algorithms to
        be implemented in very great detail.&nbsp; The flowcharts
        described the algorithms in such detail that the programmer had
        very few options left open to him in actually coding that
        software into a form that could be compiled or assembled.</li>
      <li>Then (and only then), software was coded.&nbsp; But the coding
        was almost entirely a slavish detail-by-detail translation of
        the flowchart into computer source-code form.</li>
    </ol>
    It was interesting (and at first frustrating) for me to discuss the
    matter of existence of the software with OBC developers, because
    from my point of view the software (source code) seemingly no longer
    existed, while from the point of view of the OBC developers the
    software did still exist to the extent that the flowcharts still
    existed ... because to them the software <span style="font-style:
      italic;">is</span> the flowchart and not the source code.&nbsp;
    The source code could always be reproduced from the flowchart,
    albeit with great effort, and not necessarily byte-for-byte
    identical to the original.&nbsp; When viewed from this perspective,
    it makes little difference how the flowchart is translated into
    computer language—whether into FORTRAN as was done for simulation
    purposes or into OBC assembly language for the mission
    computer—because regardless, it's the same flowchart so it's the
    same program.<br>

    Now, in the preceding paragraph I probably exaggerated the OBC
    developers' somewhat in order to make my point, but I think there is
    nevertheless a lot of validity in the viewpoint that was
    expressed:&nbsp; If we have the Math Flow charts, then we have the
    software.&nbsp; You'll notice from the table above that we do have
    some of the Math Flow charts, though the validity of what we have
    could be debated.<br>
    <br>
    I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to decide whether or not
    we actually have any of the software, or whether or not we're
    rationalizing.<br>

    While I present a general acknowledgements and "homage" to the
    original OBC developers in general at the very end of this web-page,
    let me mention here the OBC developers who have been so directly
    helpful to me.&nbsp; In no particular order:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Gene Mertz</li>
      <li>Charlie Leist</li>
      <li>Alden Minnick</li>
      <li>Don O'Neill</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="General_Characteristics_of_the_Computer"
        id="General_Characteristics_of_the_Computer"></a>General
      Characteristics of the OBC</h3>
    The OBC measured 18.9"(H)×14.5"(W)×12.75"(D), and weighed 58.98
    pounds.&nbsp; OBC power was supplied by the IGS Power Supply, which
    was itself powered from the spacecraft's main +28VDC bus or (for
    very brief main-power outages or brownouts) the Auxiliary Computer
    Power Unit (ACPU).&nbsp; The OBC required various voltages
    (+27.2VDC, +9.3VDC -27.2VDC, +20VDC, +28VDC, and 26VAC, but the
    existing documentation is inconsistent on the exact voltages used),
    and itself supplied the MDIU (+25VDC, -25VDC +8VDC) and these latter
    three voltages were what was actually used internally by the OBC
    itself.<br>
    <br>
    The computing characteristics were:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>39 bits per memory word.&nbsp; Each memory word comprised
        three "syllables" (syllable 0, syllable 1, and syllable 2) of 13
        bits each.</li>
      <li>4096 words of memory, in a ferrite core array.&nbsp; All of
        this RAM was writable—i.e., there was no read-only memory—but
        the readout of the memory was non-destructive.</li>
      <li>The memory was logically divided into 16 "sectors" of 256
        words each.</li>
      <li>At any given time only 2 sectors are actually accessible, the
        current sector (selectable under program control) and the
        "residual" sector (sector 17 octal).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The third syllables of memory words were writable by the OBC
        hardware, but this function was disabled after the spacecraft
        left the hangar, so at that point the 3rd syllables were
        effectively read-only.&nbsp; Consequently, data words always
        needed to be placed into the first two syllables of memory
        words.&nbsp; The addressing of data by CPU instructions enforced
        this data alignment anyway.<br>
      </li>
      <li>"Instruction words" were 13 bits each, and "data words" were
        26 bits each, so any given memory word could have had a data
        word and/or several instruction words packed into it.&nbsp;
        There were also provisions for "short" data words of 13 bits,
        but these short data words could be used only for testing
        purposes by <a href="#Aerospace_Ground_Equipment_AGE">Aerospace
          Ground Equipment</a> (AGE), and so were irrelevant for
        software.</li>
      <li>Integer arithmetic was 2's-complement.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Instruction cycle time was 140 μs and all instructions
        required a single cycle except for MLT and DIV.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

      of Memory Words</h3>
    I should make it clear that in this section I'm describing my
    perspective on the organization of OBC memory, in terms of how the
    original OBC programmers would have worked with it, in terms of how
    one would work with it using the tools I've created for this site,
    and in terms of what I think would be the thinking of "modern"
    programmers at the time I'm writing these words (2011).&nbsp; I'm
    not slavishly reproducing here the material on memory organization
    from the most-complete documentation available to us, namely the
    "Guidance and Control" sections (Section VIII) of the <span
      style="font-style: italic;">Project Gemini Familiarization Manual</span>,
    <a href="Documents/GeminiManualVol1Sec2.pdf"> Volume 1</a> and <a
      href="Documents/GeminiManualVol2Sec2.pdf"> Volume 2</a>, because
    that documentation seems to me to conflict with what I've been told
    by actual OBC programmers.&nbsp; The specific area of difficulty is
    bit-ordering within memory words.&nbsp; You see, the memory was
    accessed by a kind of serial interface, and the natural hardware
    view is in terms of the time-order in which the bits are shifted in
    and out ... whereas the natural software or mathematical view is in
    terms of which bits are the most-significant or least-significant—or
    as normally represented, which bits are on the "left" and which are
    on the "right".&nbsp; So I'll adopt the latter perspective, but if
    you wish to explore what the documentation says on the topic of
    bit-ordering, feel free to do so.<br>
    <br>
    In all cases, when I show you binary or octal representations of OBC
    memory, it will use the notation common today, in which the
    least-significant bits or octal digits are on the right and the
    most-significant bits or octal digits are on the left.<br>
    <br>
    As mentioned earlier, memory words are 39 bits, comprising three
    13-bit "syllables".&nbsp; In most ways, the syllable is really the
    natural memory unit, and not the word.&nbsp; Except in one specific
    case, storing and retrieving 26-bit data, syllables within a memory
    word are completely unrelated to (and independent of) each
    other.&nbsp; So you're really best served by thinking of memory as a
    set of syllables rather than a set of words.<br>
    <br>
    Not all syllables are created equal.&nbsp; In the normal operating
    mode of the OBC at mission time, the following rules apply:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>All CPU instructions which fetch, store, or otherwise operate
        on data stored in memory work <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
        with 26-bit (2-syllable) data words in which the
        less-significant syllable is stored in syllable 0 of memory and
        the more-significant word is stored in syllable 1 (in the same
        word) of memory.</li>
      <li>Only syllables 0 and 1 are capable of being modified.&nbsp;
        Syllable 2 is read-only.</li>
      <li>Therefore, as you can imagine, all data other than code is
        allocated in syllables 0 and 1.</li>
      <li>Code is commonly stored in syllable 2 ... though since data
        does not use all of syllables 0 and 1, some code will be stored
        in syllables 0 and 1 as well.</li>
    </ul>
    (There's also a less-common operating mode called "half-word mode"
    which has somewhat different rules, but this mode has limited usage
    so we'll return to it later rather than diverting the main
    discussion.)<br>
    <br>
    Now let's look at some common syllable or double-syllable formats.<br>
    <br>
    Every CPU instruction consists of a single syllable, in the
    following bit layout:<br>
    <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PPPPAAAAAAAAA</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    where <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PPPP</span>
    is a 4-bit code identifying the specific CPU instruction (the "op
    code") and <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">AAAAAAAAA</span> is a 9-bit code (3 octal
    digits) identifying (in a way that varies by instruction type) the
    operand for the instruction.&nbsp; Conventionally, OBC programmers
    name the individual bits like so:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">OP4</span>
        is the most-significant bit of <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PPPP</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">OP1</span>
        is the least-significant.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A9</span>
        is the most-significant bit of <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">AAAAAAAAA</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A1</span>
        is the least-significant.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    In most instruction types, <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">A1-A8</span> select a particular memory
    word.&nbsp; Since there are only 8 bits, only 256 different words
    are accessible.&nbsp; Recall, moreover, that memory consists of 16
    sectors of 256 words each of 3 syllables each.&nbsp; So the
    instruction is able to select a specific word address, but the
    sector containing the word and the syllable within the word can't be
    selected ... those have to be known by other means, which we'll
    discuss later; for now, just realize that at any time there's some
    "current sector" and "current syllable", and that whatever the CPU
    is doing operates within that current selection.&nbsp; When <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A1-A8</span>
    is interpreted in this way, <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">A9</span> can be used to override the
    current sector and instead to do a one-time selection of sector 0,
    which is referred to as the "residual sector".&nbsp; <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A9=0</span>
    means to use the current sector and <span style="font-family:
      Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A9=1</span> means to use the
    residual sector.&nbsp; But there's no way to select a different
    sector or a different syllable on an individual-instruction basis.<br>
    <br>
    Several instructions use a scheme in which the field consisting of
    bits <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A1-A3</span>
    is given the name "X" and <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">A4-A6</span> are given the name "Y", thus
    giving the instruction two independent parameters.&nbsp; In those
    cases, <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A7</span>
    and <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A8</span>
    are unused, and <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">A9</span> may or may supply additional
    functionality<br>
    <br>
    For normal 26-bit data, recall that a standard 2's-complement format
    is used.&nbsp; OBC programmers conventionally refer to the sign bit
    (i.e., the most-significant bit if interpreting the data as an
    unsigned integer) as <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">S</span>, to the most-significant non-sign
    bit as <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">M25</span>,
    and to the least-significant bit as <span style="font-family:
      Courier New,Courier,monospace;">M1</span>. Therefore, in a word
    containing such data, syllable 1 will contain <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">S</span> and <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">M25-M14</span>;
    syllable 0 will contain <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">M13-M1</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Numerical data can be interpreted in two different ways, depending
    on the interpretation of the software.&nbsp; Obviously, the data
    could be interpreted as a simple 2's complement integer.&nbsp; It
    can also be interpreted as a fractional value with absolute value
    less than 1.0.&nbsp; In the latter interpretation, there is some
    scaling factor needed to relate the actual value of the number to
    the binary value that's stored in memory. The OBC and its software
    have no method for dealing with scaling factors, and it was up to
    the programmer to understand which interpretation was used, as well
    as to explicitly scale values during computations to avoid overflow
    and loss of significant bits.<br>
    <br>
    An important variation in which 26 bits of data aren't numerical in
    nature is the so-called "HOP constant".&nbsp; A "HOP constant" is
    used by a dedicated CPU instruction (<span style="font-family:
      courier new,courier,monospace;">HOP</span>)&nbsp; to change things
    such as the currently-selected memory sector and syllable by loading
    a hidden CPU register that can't be accessed by other means. The
    layout of a HOP constant is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;">xxxxxxxxHxSSxPPPPAAAAAAAAA</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    In this scheme:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Bits <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">AAAAAAAAA</span> are given names <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A9-A1</span>
        and are interpreted as described earlier, in that they allow
        selection of a word address (0-255) and provide an override for
        current-sector vs. residual sector.&nbsp; After the <span
          style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">HOP</span>
        instruction executes, this setting persists within the CPU's
        hidden HOP register only for the current instruction and is then
        incremented to the next sequential word (or to some other word
        if a branch occurs).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bits <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">SS</span>, respectively given the
        names <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SYB</span>
        and <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SYA</span>,&nbsp;
specify









        the current syllable:&nbsp; 00 for syllable 0, 01 for syllable
        1, and 10 for syllable 2.&nbsp; After the <span
          style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">HOP</span>
        instruction executes, this setting persists until another <span
          style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">HOP</span>
        instruction changes it.</li>
      <li>Bits <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">PPPP</span>, respectively given the
        names <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">S4-S1</span>,
        specify the current sector.&nbsp; After the <span
          style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">HOP</span>
        instruction executes, this setting persists until another <span
          style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">HOP</span>
        instruction changes it, though as we've seen it can be
        overridden to instead use sector 0 on an
        instruction-by-instruction basis using the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">A9</span>
        feature possessed by some of the CPU instructions.<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">H</span>
        selects between "normal" mode (<span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">H=0</span>) and "half-word" mode (<span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">H=1</span>),








        and this mode persists until another <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span> instruction changes
        it.&nbsp; "Normal" mode is what I've been describing to you up
        to this point.&nbsp; In half-word mode (HWM), the data comes
        from syllable 2&nbsp; rather than syllables 0,1, and therefore
        is only 13 bits rather than 26.&nbsp; When the CPU fetches such
        data from memory, it fills the least-significant 13 bits of the
        CPU's accumulator register, while the most-significant 13-bits
        are all 0.&nbsp; An interesting consequence of being in the
        half-word mode is that <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span>
        <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">HOP</span>
        instruction will return to normal mode (since <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">H</span>
        is among the higher 13 bits of a HOP constant) and the current
        syllable will always become 0 (since <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SYB</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SYA</span>
        are also among the 13 more-significant bits).&nbsp; Moreover,
        since the the OBC's ability to write to syllable 2 is disabled
        after the spacecraft has left the hangar, no <span
          style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">STO</span>
        or <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">SPQ</span>
        have any effect in half-word mode.<br>
      </li>
      <li>At power-up, the behavior differed between the early Gemini
        missions without ATM (Auxiliary Tape Memory), and the later ones
        with ATM:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Without ATM, it is as if a HOP constant is loaded that puts
          the unit in normal mode (i.e., not half-word mode) at syllable
          0 of word 0 in sector 0.</li>
        <li>With ATM, it is as if a HOP constant is loaded that puts the
          unit into half-word mode at syllable 2 of word 0 in sector 0.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    You may wonder what half-word mode is good for?&nbsp; Well,
    originally, it seems to have been intended for testing
    purposes.&nbsp; Later, when the flight-program outstripped the size
    of available memory, it became necessary to add the ATM and use it
    to overlay programs at runtime.&nbsp; In that case, I guess, it's
    useful to be able to run a program entirely within syllable 2 (which
    is read-only) without fear that the ATM can overlay it.&nbsp; But
    you know, I'm not really sure.<br>
    <h3><a name="Instruction_Sequencing" id="Instruction_Sequencing"></a>Instruction









      Sequencing</h3>
    You may naïvely suppose (I did!) if you did not read the preceding
    section in great detail, that the everyday usage of the words "word"
    and "syllable" applies similarly in stepping through the OBC
    instructions.&nbsp; In proceeding through a sentence of natural
    language like English, you use up all of the syllables in a word
    before proceeding to the next word.&nbsp; So you might suppose that
    OBC instructions would sequence in a manner something like the
    following:&nbsp; word <span style="font-style: italic; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N</span> syllable 0, word <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N</span> syllable 1, word <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N</span> syllable 2, word <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N+1</span> syllable 0, word <span
      style="font-style: italic; font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N+1</span> syllable 1, and so
    on.&nbsp; In fact, this is not the case at all, and (as you may
    infer from the instruction definitions in the following section)
    would have caused insuperable difficulties.&nbsp; So get the naïve
    interpretation right out of your head!<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Instead,</span> the instruction
    sequencing was like this:<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
      word 0 syllable <span style="font-style: italic; font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N<br>
      </span> word 1 syllable <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N<br>
      </span> word 2 syllable <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">N<br>
      </span> etc.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    so that the syllable number never changed automatically as you
    progressed through the program.&nbsp; But you could always change
    the syllable manually by executing an instruction (<big><span
        style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span></big>)&nbsp;
and









    a HOP constant specifically designed to change the syllable
    number.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    In retrospect, from an outsiders point of view, it would perhaps
    have been less confusing in terms of instruction sequencing if the
    OBC hardware designers had used the word "paragraph" rather than
    "syllable".&nbsp; Alas! it's a bit late to worry about that
    now.&nbsp; The OBC programmers I've consulted seem to think that
    this is a perfectly natural scheme, and don't seem to have
    experienced any confusion over the concept of "syllables".&nbsp;<br>
    <h3><a name="CPU_Instructions" id="CPU_Instructions"></a>CPU
      Instructions</h3>
    If you're interested in Gemini, you may not be very interested in
    Apollo's <a href="LVDC.html#CPU_Instructions">LVDC</a> instruction
    set.&nbsp; But there are so many similarities between the two that
    I'll probably not be able to resist the temptation to point out some
    of the differences as I proceed.&nbsp; A difference not pointed out
    in the table below is that the LVDC instructions <span
      style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">MPH</span>, <span
      style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">XOR</span>,
    and <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">CDS</span>,
    <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
    are not present in the OBC.<br>
    <br>
    Note that in what follows, a name representing a location of memory
    holding an instruction is called a "left-hand symbol" in the
    parlance of the Gemini OBC programmers, and I will continue to call
    it that (or LHS for short) rather than adopting more-current
    terminology.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, when I talk below about the assembly-language syntax of the
    instructions, I'm referring to the syntax supported by my own <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> assembler presented as a
    download on this website.&nbsp; This syntax is very similar to the
    original OBC assembler's syntax but we can't be sure it's identical
    because no documentation for the original assembler has been located
    up to this point in time.<br>

          <td style="vertical-align: middle;"> This instruction combines
            an unconditional jump instruction with various other
            configuration options, such as memory-sector
            selection.&nbsp; The way it works is that the address A1-A9
            points to a memory word that contains a "HOP constant", and
            the <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span> instruction transfers
            that HOP constant into the HOP register.&nbsp; Recall that
            A1-A8 select the offset within a 256-word sector, and A9 is
            the "residual bit" that selects between the current sector
            and the "residual sector".&nbsp; There is no provision for a
            partial HOP constant, and the full HOP constant needs to be
            given every time a <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span> instruction is
            used.&nbsp; See also <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">TRA</span>.<br>
            <br>
            However ... the fact that <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span> operates on HOP
            constants rather than on the left-hand symbols that are the
            labels for locations in the code as actually understood by
            the programmers, is not very convenient.&nbsp; The simple
            act of HOPping to a location would have to look something
            like this:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
                Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HTARGET &nbsp; HOPC
                &nbsp;&nbsp; TARGET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Set up a HOP
                constant for the target location.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HTARGET&nbsp;&nbsp; # HOP to
                the target location<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ...<br>
                TARGET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#









                Location we want to HOP to.</span><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            This is pretty cumbersome.&nbsp; The assembler therefore
            provides a special feature in that if the operand of a HOP
            is a left-hand symbol for a code location, which would
            otherwise be illegal, the assembler silently allocates and
            initializes a HOP constant of the same name, but enclosed in
            parentheses, and then it pretends that the operand of the
            HOP was really the newly-created HOP constant.&nbsp;
            Therefore, in assembly language, the following becomes legal
            even though seemingly illegal in machine code:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family:
                Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TARGET&nbsp;&nbsp; #
                HOP to the target location<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
                TARGET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#









                Location we want to HOP to.<br>
              </span></div>
            <br>
            But what the assembler really outputs in this case is the
            same as in the first example (with the HOP constant named "<span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">(TARGET)</span>"
            instead of "<span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">HTARGET</span>").<br>
            <br>
            The assembler performs a similar service for the <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLA</span>
            and <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">STO</span> instructions (see
            below). There are some drawbacks to this special feature as
            well, namely:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Any left-hand symbols used as targets of HOPs in this
                way must be 6 characters or less rather than 8.</li>
              <li>The assembler always creates the implicit HOP
                constants in the residual sector 17, syllable 0.</li>
              <li>Since there are no explicit allocations for the
                implicit HOP constants, it's easy for the programmer to
                overlook that they're being created, and therefore to be
                less aware of the rate at which memory is being used up.</li>
              <li>There's no provision for half-word mode.</li>
            </ul>
            Fortunately, there's no drawback here that can't be worked
            around by explicitly defining any troublesome HOP constants
            needed, as in the first example.<br>

            quotient.&nbsp; Recall that A1-A8 select the offset within a

            between the current sector and the "residual sector".&nbsp;

            these are called "channels".&nbsp; In current terminology,
            we'd probably usually refer to them as "ports".)&nbsp;
            Whether or not an input or an output is performed depends on
            the particular signal chosen.&nbsp; The X (A1-A3) and Y
            (A4-A6) operand fields are used for signal selection.&nbsp;
            A9 is used as well.&nbsp; For an output operation, it
            determines if the accumulator should be cleared after the
            output (A9=1) or preserved (A9=0).&nbsp;&nbsp; For an input
            operation, it determines if the data should be loaded into
            the accumulator (A9=1) or logically OR'd with the
            accumulator (A9=0).&nbsp; A table of the i/o signals vs.
            addresses is given in the <a
              href="#IO_Ports_For_PRO_Instruction">following section</a>.&nbsp;








            (The <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span> instruction is
            essentially equivalent to the <a
              href="LVDC.html#CPU_Instructions">LVDC</a> <span
              style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PIO</span>
            instruction, but the selection of i/o signals is different.)<br>
            <br>
            The documentation does not explain this, but I think that
            when the <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span> instruction is
            accessing a single-bit signal, only the accumulator's sign
            bit is used as the output or the input.&nbsp; (I'm not sure
            what the effect on other bit-positions should be on input.)<br>
            <br>
            There are several allowable assembly-language syntaxes for

            Note that as with the <span style="font-family: Courier

            assembler allows seemingly meaningless usages like "<span

            of a code location rather that the name of a variable or
            constant.&nbsp; What the assembler does in this case is
            automatically, silently to create a HOP constant in memory
            called "<span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">(LHS)</span>", and then to
            substitute the "<span style="font-family: Courier

            instruction.&nbsp; It multiplies two 24-bit numbers to
            produce a 26-bit product.&nbsp; The accumulator provides the
            address of one multiplication factor, and the address
            embedded in the instruction points to the other
            factor.&nbsp; Recall that A1-A8 select the offset within a

            are used, and the least-significant 2 bits of the operand

            But what do "left" and "right" mean?&nbsp; Fortunately,
            "left" implies multiplication by powers of two, and "right"
            division by powers of two, just as modern programmers are
            accustomed to.<br>
            <br>
            For the left-shifts, 0 is shifted into the least-significant
            bit at the right.&nbsp; For the right-shifts, the sign-bit
            is duplicated into the most-significant bit at the left.<br>
            <br>
            For illegal X,Y combinations, the accumulator is zeroed.<br>

              New,Courier,monospace;">TNZ</span> is either an existing
            left-hand symbol for an instruction (rather than for a
            variable or constant), or else an expression of the form "*+<span
              style="font-style: italic;">N</span>" or "*-<span
              style="font-style: italic;">N</span>", where <span
              style="font-style: italic;">N</span> is any number from 1
            to 7.&nbsp; The usage of the latter relative-addressing
            forms isn't illustrated in the code example for <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">TNZ</span>,
            but you can look at the code example for <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">TRA</span>
            instead; it works exactly the same for <span

    Note that in assembly language, in the operand for a <span

    instruction, the Y operand field would proceed the X operand
    field.&nbsp; So, for example, if X=3 and Y=4, the instruction would
    be <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO43</span>.&nbsp;

            digit is 1, the leftmost message digit is 2, and so on.</td>

            are actually -999 to +999, in theory the adjustment range is
            more than full.&nbsp; In practice, only very small
            adjustments would be made.&nbsp; My understanding of what
            the hardware actually does is to increment or decrement the
            displays by 1 every 21.5 ms., and that it will not be ready
            to process another delta-V until the count has reached
            zero.&nbsp; For example, trying to change the display by 25
            would take about half a second, and no other outputs to the
            IVI should take place in that interval.&nbsp; The "Velocity

            to how the data appearing in the accumulator is packed, but
            my nearest guess as to what it's trying to tell us is that
            each of the X, Y, and Z axis readings is a 4-bit
            2's-complement value (thus being in the range -8 to +7), and
            that they are packed into the accumulator as follows:<br>

    <h3><a name="Subroutine_Linkage" id="Subroutine_Linkage"></a>Subroutines</h3>
    As weird as it may seem in modern terms, <span style="font-style:
      italic;">the Gemini OBC CPU had no mechanism for easily
      implementing subroutines</span>.&nbsp; Further, the
    assembly-language source code for the OBC slavishly implemented what
    is basically a state machine, using the separately designed "math
    flow" as a pattern.&nbsp; Therefore <span style="font-style:
      italic;">the OBC software developers had little need for
      subroutines</span>.&nbsp; You may think I'm wrong about this, but
    I've pursued this question with several OBC developers to an extent
    they probably consider tiresome—fortunately, they've been very
    patient!—and I think that this is an inescapable conclusion.&nbsp;
    Therefore, while the OBC may have been a splendid mechanism for
    developing state machines, it would have been very tiresome for
    developing general-purpose software without any easy subroutine
    mechanism.<br>
    <br>
    Now, there <span style="font-style: italic;">were</span> a few
    subroutines, but they weren't created willy-nilly during development
    as we often do today.&nbsp; Indeed, the full list (give or take a
    few due to errors), including some explanation of how to set up the
    inputs and retrieve the outputs of the subroutines, can be found in
    the Gemini Programming Manual.&nbsp; In modern terms, we'd probably
    think of these as library routines, but in Gemini they were the <span
      style="font-style: italic;">only</span> subroutines.&nbsp; I'll
    return to this topic of library routines at the end of the section.<br>
    <br>
    Naturally, since there were some subroutines, there had to be some
    software workaround for the fact that the CPU itself didn't support
    subroutines, and it seems to have been this:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Before calling a subroutine such as SQROOT, the calling
        program would load the accumulator with the HOP constant of the
        location to which the subroutine was supposed to return, and
        then HOP to the subroutine.</li>
      <li>While we don't actually have any of the math subroutines to
        look at, presumably the math subroutine would have to:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Save the accumulator in a variable.</li>
        <li>Do whatever computations it was supposed to do.</li>
        <li>HOP to the saved return address.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    In terms of the native capabilities of the machine code, it's
    actually very cumbersome to accomplish all of this, since it's
    necessary to set up several HOP constants (one for the subroutine
    entry point and one for each potential return address), each of
    which has names that must be distinct from the names of the
    subroutine and return points themselves.&nbsp; But you may have
    noticed from the earlier descriptions of the <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP</span>, <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLA</span>,
    and <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">STO</span>
    instructions that the assembler implements a feature for them in
    which left-hand symbols can be used as their operands (which would
    otherwise be illegal), and the assembler simply automatically
    creates HOP constants as necessary.&nbsp; Therefore, even though
    what's going on behind the scenes is somewhat more complex, the
    assembly language for the subroutine linkage as described above
    simply looks like this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        CLA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RETADR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Set up the
        return address.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        SUBROU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # HOP to the subroutine.<br>
        RETADR&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; # Subroutine returns to here.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
        RSUBROU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Variable to hold SUBROU's return
        address.<br>
        SUBROU&nbsp; STO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RSUBROU&nbsp;&nbsp; # Enter
        SUBROU, store return address.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Do stuff
        inside of SUBROU.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        RSUBROU&nbsp;&nbsp; # Return from SUBROU.<br>
      </span><br>
    </div>
    There are several HOP constants used here ("<span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">(SUBROU)</span>"
    and "<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">(RETADR)</span>"),
but









    the assembler creates them transparently, and the programmer doesn't
    have to know about them unless he suddenly finds himself out of
    memory.&nbsp; In this example, <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">RSUBROU</span> also holds a HOP constant,
    but is nevertheless just a normal variable that hasn't been handled
    in any special way by the assembler.&nbsp; (A construct like "<span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLA *+2</span>"
    seems like it would be useful here, since it would have eliminated
    the need to explicitly define the symbol <span style="font-family:
      Courier New,Courier,monospace;">RETADR</span>. But the OBC
    developers haven't mentioned doing anything like that, so I haven't
    bothered to implement it.&nbsp; This makes sense in light of the
    Math Flow diagrams from which the code was created, because they
    include the detail of setting up the return addresses.&nbsp; Hence
    to conform to the Math Flow, the coders would have explicitly set up
    the return addresses anyway.)<br>
    <br>
    I suppose I should make it clear that I'm not honestly sure that the
    original OBC assembler worked in this way.&nbsp; But multiple OBC
    developers have made it clear to me that this is the way they recall
    handling subroutines, even though the explanation of why it was <span
      style="font-style: italic;">legal</span> to do so (in light of the
    contradictory machine-code characteristics) has been lost in the
    ensuing decades.&nbsp; So I see little alternative to supposing that
    the original assembler did indeed have a similar feature.<br>
    <br>
    Before leaving the subject of subroutines, let me just briefly
    return to the list of existing subroutines on pages 21-24 the <a
      href="Documents/GeminiProgrammingManual.pdf"> Gemini Programming
      Manual</a> that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; One of the most
    important subroutines is <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">I/O</span>, which seems to be rather
    mysterious and we're unfortunately told little about it; it appears
    to be an exception in that no return address was supposed to be
    supplied to it.&nbsp; The most complete information is available for
    the subroutines listed on page 22 of the manual, since for those
    routines there's actually some documentation about how to set up the
    inputs and how to fetch the outputs of the subroutines.&nbsp; I've
    collected a little additional information on some of those routines
    not covered by the manual, and will present that info here just for
    the sake of completeness:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">ROOTSUM</span>
        computed the square root of the squares of its two arguments.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SQROOT</span>
        seemingly accepted its input in the variable <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">ALPHA1</span>
        and output the square root in variable <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">ALPHA3</span>.&nbsp;









        The input variable <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">ALPHA2</span> was a first guess at the
        result, to speed up the computation.<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SINCOS</span>,
        listed in the manual as "SIN COS" is a single routine that
        returns both the sine and cosine.&nbsp; The input was in units
        of degrees.<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">ATANGM</span>,
        computed the arctangent, <span style="font-style: italic;">probably</span>
        of the ratio <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">GAMMA1</span>/<span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">GAMMA2</span>
        of the input variables.&nbsp; The output is thought to be in
        units of radians.<br>
      </li>
      <li>There was also a routine to compute the tangent, even though
        it's missing from the tables.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">LOG</span>
        is the base 10 logarithm.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Sadly, I'm not aware of what most of the other routines actually
    did.&nbsp; Though not a subroutine as such, the code identified as
    the "Executer" was very important and deserves some special
    attention.&nbsp; Also known as <font><font color="black">the
        executive program (commonly called Hard Core), it was assigned
        to sector 00 and contained code&nbsp;common to all mode programs</font></font><font><font
        color="black"> (Pre-Launch, Ascent, Catch-up, Rendezvous,
        Re-entry)</font></font><font><font color="black">, such as:<br>
      </font></font>
    <ul>
      <li><font><font color="black">resetting discrete outputs</font></font></li>
      <li><font><font color="black">reading time programs</font></font></li>
      <li><font><font color="black">subroutines</font></font></li>
      <li><font><font color="black">timing programs</font></font></li>
      <li><font><font color="black">go-nogo-go routine</font></font></li>
      <li><font><font color="black">setting computer malfunction light</font></font></li>
      <li><font><font color="black">AGE routine</font></font></li>
      <li><font><font color="black">logic to jump to the mode programs<br>
          </font></font></li>
    </ul>
    <font><font color="black">The Executer and whatever mode program
        happened to be active functioned somewhat like coroutines.&nbsp;
        After each pass through a mode program, there was always a
        return to the beginning of the&nbsp;executive program, where the
        discrete outputs were set, time was read again, and so
        forth.&nbsp; After the Executer pass, control was passed back to
        the mode program again, and this process of cycling back and
        forth between the Executor and the mode program continued.<br>
      </font></font><big><font><font size="2" color="black"><big><br>
          </big></font></font></big> There's also a little information
    available on placement of some of these subroutines (and other
    programs) in memory ... though, other than the Executer and MDIU
    programs, I'm told that the placement of the various subprograms in
    memory may not have been terribly important.&nbsp; As of early 1963,
    prior to the ATM and in-flight swapping of programs in and out of
    memory, the following is known about memory placement (thanks to
    notes by Alden Minnick):<br>

    But I suspect these allocations changed a lot after that as, for
    example, I'm also told that at some point the MDIU was assigned to
    sector 17 (octal) rather than 11 (octal).<br>

    </h4>
    It was possible to digitally uplink data from ground control to the
    OBC, via the Digital Command System (DCS).&nbsp; The procedure for
    fetching a single word from the DCS is as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Poll <span style="font-family: courier
          new,courier,monospace;">CLD06</span> at intervals of 50 ms. or
        less to determine if data is ready.<br>
      </li>
      <li>When data is ready:</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO01</span>
          to tell the enable the DCS to send the data.</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO00</span>
          to fetch the 24-bit data word into the accumulator bits
          M1-M24.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    In the fetched word, bits M1-M18 contain a data value, while bits
    M19-M24 contain an address in the range 000-077.&nbsp; The flight
    software is expected to store the data at the specified address.<br>
    <br>
    The obvious limitations here are that full 26-bit data words are not
    provided and that the address-range covered is limited.&nbsp; As a
    variation, there is an "extended" protocol that transmits word pairs
    rather than single words.&nbsp; The extended protocol allows 26-bit
    data words and slightly extends the covered address range.&nbsp; It
    works as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Consecutive command words are transmitted to address 20
        followed by address 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Rather than writing to either address 20 or 21, the two 18-bit
        data fields are combined into a 36-bit structure.</li>
      <li>A full 26-bit data field and up to 10 address bits can be
        extracted from the 36-bit structure.&nbsp; The locations of
        these fields are TBD.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The 26-bit data is actually written to the 10-bit address, if
        the 10-bit address was in the range 000-117 octal.</li>
    </ul>

    Conversely, telemetry data could be digitally downlinked from the

    words to the Instrumentation System (IS) for downlinking every 2.4
    seconds.&nbsp; The flight software would snapshot the values of 21
    memory locations (dependent on the operational mode) into a memory
    buffer, and then to output the contents of that buffer for
    transmission.&nbsp; Specifically, the way it works is that:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">CLD07</span>
        is polled at 50 ms. or less intervals.&nbsp; When it becomes
        active (accumulator negative), the steps below are taken.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">CLD12</span>
        is tested.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If the accumulator is negative, then the software should
          snapshot the mode-dependent 21 memory locations into the
          buffer and output the first buffer word with a <span
            style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO10</span>
          instruction.</li>
        <li>If instead the accumulator positive or zero, then the
          software should output the next buffer word in sequence using
          a <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO10</span>
          instruction.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3><a name="Rendezvous_Radar" id="Rendezvous_Radar"></a>Rendezvous
      Radar</h3>
    For those spacecraft having a Rendezvous Radar, the following
    procedure is used to fetch data from it:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO63</span>
        is used to reset the radar's discrete input buffer.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO01</span>
        is used to tell the radar that the OBC wants data.</li>
      <li>Wait 20 ms.</li>
      <li>Test if data available using <span style="font-family:
          courier new,courier,monospace;">CLD00</span>.</li>
      <li>If data is ready (i.e., if accumulator is negative), perform a
        code-sequence like the following:</li>
    </ol>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: courier
        new,courier,monospace;">PRO00<br>
        STO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RANGE&nbsp;&nbsp; # 15 BITS<br>
        PRO00<br>
        STO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SINAZI&nbsp; # SINE OF AZIMUTH, 10
        BITS<br>
        PRO00<br>
        STO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SINELEV # SINE OF ELEVATION, 10 BITS<br>
      </span></div>
    <br>
    The Range data is positive (being a magnitude),&nbsp; and is stored
    in accumulator bits M8-M24.&nbsp; The least-significant bit (M25) is
    thus not used.&nbsp; If M8-M11, the 4 most-significant bits, are all
    1, then the data should be discarded.&nbsp; The two sine values are
    stored in M15-M24.<br>
    <h3><a name="Aerospace_Ground_Equipment_AGE"
        id="Aerospace_Ground_Equipment_AGE"></a>Aerospace Ground
      Equipment (AGE)</h3>
    The AGE provides a dedicated data link from the OBC to (as implied
    by the name) aerospace ground equipment, and provides a way of
    performing tests or other diagnostic activities by connecting
    special equipment.&nbsp; The technique of reading a word from the
    AGE is as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Poll <span style="font-family: courier
          new,courier,monospace;">CLD32</span> until active (accumulator
        negative).</li>
      <li>Fetch an 18-bit word by repeating the following 18 times:</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO23</span>
          with accumulator negative.&nbsp; (Starts a pulse on the AGE
          data clock.)</li>
        <li>Wait 2.5 ms.</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO23</span>
          with accumulator positive or zero.&nbsp; (Ends the clock
          pulse.)</li>
        <li>Wait 1.5 ms.</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">CLD27</span>.&nbsp;
(Reads









          the data bit.)</li>
        <li>Wait 1.5 ms.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    Assuming that what the software does with this data is to pack it
    into bits M1-M18 of a data word, with the first bit read going into
    M1 and so forth, M4-M1 will contain an operation code. The
    operation-code bits specify the requested operation as follows:<br>

    <br>
    As you can see, one of these commands causes a memory word to be
    read and reported back through the interface, while the others are
    supposed to trigger the OBC software to perform some operation.<br>
    <br>
    When data is being read back (operation 0001), the data word read
    from the AGE link is interpreted as follows:&nbsp; M5-M12 will
    contain a data address (A1-A8), M13 (A9) will contain a bit related
    to AGE internal clock pulse timing, M14-M17 will identify the sector
    (S1-S4) of the requested data, and S5 will identify the syllable of
    the requested data.&nbsp; (By selecting S5=0, the data is taken from
    syllables 0,1.&nbsp; By selecting S5=1, the data is taken from
    syllable 2 with an implied but fictitious syllable 3 that is
    entirely 0.)&nbsp; The first bit transmitted is the most-significant
    bit of higher selected syllable and the last bit transmitted is the
    least-significant bit of lower selected syllable.&nbsp; The actual
    transmission technique is to repeat the following 26 times, in
    most-significant to least-significant bit order:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Load the accumulator so that the bit to be sent is the sign
        bit.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO22</span>
        to output the bit.</li>
      <li>Wait 2.5 ms.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO23</span>
        with accumulator negative.&nbsp; (Start AGE data clock pulse.)</li>
      <li>Wait 2 ms.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO23</span>
        with accumulator positive or zero.&nbsp; (End clock pulse.)</li>
      <li>Wait 2 ms.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">PRO22</span>
        with accumulator positive or zero.&nbsp; (Put AGE datalink line
        back to its normal resting state.)</li>
      <li>Wait 1 ms.</li>
    </ol>
    (The manual states that specifically that "there is a delay of 4.5
    ms. between resetting clock 18 and setting clock 19".&nbsp; I cannot
    fathom any meaning in this statement, so I simply report it as
    written.)<br>
    <br>
    As far as the "Set XXX ladder outputs" operations are concerned
    (0101, 0110, 0111, and 1000), the data word read from the AGE is
    interpreted as a sign bit at M18 and a 6-bit data word (D1-D6) at
    M12-M17.&nbsp; What is done with this data is TBD.<br>
    <h3><a name="Time_Reference_System_TRS"
        id="Time_Reference_System_TRS"></a>Time Reference System (TRS)</h3>
    The Time Reference System (TRS) keeps track of elapsed time from
    lift-off, and provides count-down times to retrograde and to
    equipment reset.&nbsp; It counts in 1/8-second increments.&nbsp; The
    timings being tracked can be transferred to the OBC or set from the
    OBC, and they can be set by other means such as manual entry and
    digital uplink from the ground.<br>
    <br>
    The TRS can be accessed by the OBC in one of two modes:&nbsp;
    "readout mode", which is activated by <span style="font-family:
      Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO21</span> with the accumulator
    negative, and "enter mode", which is activated by <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO21</span>
    with the accumulator positive or zero.&nbsp; In readout mode, the
    elapsed time (ET), the time until retrograde (T<sub>R</sub>) or the
    time until equipment reset (T<sub>X</sub>) is transferred from the
    OBC to the TRS.&nbsp; In enter mode, the transfer is instead from
    the TRS to the OBC.&nbsp; If T<sub>R</sub> reaches zero, then a
    discrete from the TRS which can be read with <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD05</span>
    becomes active, and the software is generally expected to poll this
    discrete so that it can know when to begin retrograde.<br>
    <br>
    The TRS has three internal 24-bit counter-buffers in which times are
    counting upward or downward, and a separate 24-bit buffer used to
    transfer data to/from the OBC.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    In order to make sense of the procedures documented in the
    familiarization manual, the <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">PRO21</span> instruction must have some
    unusual behavior, such as the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>It places the accumulator's M25 bit onto the output line to
        the TRS.</li>
      <li>It places the signal from the input line from the TRS into the
        accumulator's M1 bit.</li>
      <li>It generates a clock pulse for the TRS.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Readout Mode</h4>
    Here's how the OBC can write data to the TRS.<br>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO21</span>
        with accumulator negative to select readout mode.</li>
      <li>Load the accumulator with 24-bit data for the TRS.&nbsp; The
        data should be in accumulator bits M2-M25.</li>
      <li>Repeat the following 24 times:</li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO20</span>
          to output accumulator's M1 to the TRS.</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SHR1</span>
          to discard M1 from the accumulator and move the other
          accumulator bits downward.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>With the accumulator negative use (only) one of <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO14</span>,
        <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO65</span>,
        or <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO25</span>
        to strobe the TRS transfer buffer into one its ET, T<sub>R</sub>,
        or T<sub>X</sub> counter, respectively.</li>
      <li>Delay 9-15 ms.</li>
      <li>Use the same <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span> instruction from step 4,
        but with the accumulator zero or positive.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Enter Mode</h4>
    Here's how the OBC can read data from the TRS.<br>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO21</span>
        with accumulator zero or positive to select enter mode.</li>
      <li>With the accumulator negative use (only) one of <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO14</span>,
        <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO65</span>,
        or <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO25</span>
        to load the TRS ET, T<sub>R</sub>, or T<sub>X</sub> counter
        value, respectively, into its transfer buffer.</li>
      <li>Delay 9-15 ms.</li>
      <li>Use the same <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span> instruction from step 2,
        but with the accumulator positive or zero.<br>
      </li>
      <li>25 repetitions of the following steps.&nbsp; (Yes, that's 25
        repetitions, even though only 24 bits are involved.)<br>
      </li>
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO20</span>
          to get the next bit from the TRS into the accumulator's M1
          bit.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SHR1</span>
          to logically right-shift the accumulator by one place.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Notice that after the 25th step above, the first bit that was
        read will have been shifted out of the accumulator entirely, so
        only the bits from the 2nd through 25th reads will remain.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3><a name="Auxiliary_Tape_Memory_ATM"
        id="Auxiliary_Tape_Memory_ATM"></a>Auxiliary Tape Memory (ATM)</h3>
    At some point in the evolution of the operational program, feature
    creep caused the size of the operational program to overrun the
    total amount of memory provided by the ferrite array.&nbsp; For
    Gemini VIII through XII, the approach taken was to modularize the
    software in a way that allowed it to be reloaded into the OBC during
    the mission with software that was specialized for the current phase
    of the mission.&nbsp; So even though we talk (for example) about the
    "software for Gemini X", the software for Gemini X was really
    several different programs that were loaded just during the mission
    phases in which they were used.&nbsp; The programs were stored in
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Auxiliary Tape Memory</span>
    (ATM) and then transferred to the OBC.&nbsp; We are told by the <a

      Familiarization Manual</a> that<br>
    <blockquote>

        thirteen-bit words. This is about seven that of the computer
        core memory. The ATM is mounted on a cold plate in the adapter
        section of the spacecraft ...</tt></blockquote>
    From the Familiarization Manual's ATM specifications, we can figure
    out about how long a program load from the ATM into the OBC must
    have taken.&nbsp; With a total tape length of 525 feet and a
    read/write speed of 1.5 inches/second, the total tape could be read
    or written in 525×12/1.5 = 4200 seconds = 70 minutes.&nbsp; (If a
    tape rewind were needed, the full operation would also require a
    rewind at 8× speed, adding a maximum additional 8.75 minutes to the
    total operation.)&nbsp; Since the tape has a 7× capacity relative to
    the OBC core-memory capacity, any individual load, ignoring tape
    wind/rewind, would then be about 70/7 = 10 minutes.&nbsp; Since not
    all of the memory could be overwritten, and since syllable 2 of the
    39-bit memory words couldn't be changed in flight anyway, the actual
    loads would have taken less time, and is estimated at about 7
    minutes.<br>
    <br>
    Loading software from the ATM into the OBC is actually a software
    operation rather than a hardware-only operation, so it requires that
    some software—namely, the software that does the software
    loading—remain always in the OBC without being overwritten.&nbsp;
    That invariant portion of the software is known as "Module I".&nbsp;
    There were six modules in all, and I've already <a
      href="#Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software">described them above</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I can't tell you (yet) how many separate software loads occurred
    during the missions, nor which modules were loaded during these
    loads, but that is probably information we can find or deduce at
    some point in the future.&nbsp; I believe, however, that loads
    occurred during the pre-launch phase after diagnostics had been
    completed, in orbit prior to rendezvous, and after rendezvous but
    prior to re-entry.<br>

      src="GeminiPanelATM.png" align="right" width="295" height="212">The
documentation









    does not precisely describe how data is read from the ATM.&nbsp; But
    the following is my best guess as to how the actual OBC/ATM
    interface works.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Various of the <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span>/<span style="font-family:
      Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD</span> instructions mentioned
    below are repurposed from interfacing to other peripherals like the
    TRS.&nbsp; The image at right, showing the pilot controls for the
    ATM, came from the <a href="Documents/Gemini12MissionReport.pdf">
      Gemini XII Mission Report</a>. (I was obliged to replace all of
    the text to make it legible for presentation here.)&nbsp; In the
    AUTO mode, it appears as though data could be written to the tape
    using the <a href="#Aerospace_Ground_Equipment_AGE">Aerospace
      Ground Equipment</a> (AGE), but only the STDBY, REWIND, WIND, and
    PROG modes seem to have been useful during the mission.&nbsp;<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The position of the ATM mode switch can be read by combining
        the two bits from <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">CLD14</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD15</span>.&nbsp;
I









        <span style="font-style: italic;">assume</span> that being in
        STDY or not is what affects the repurposing of the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span>/<span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD</span>
        instructions I mentioned earlier and that the remaining 4
        positions are what is reported as the mode.&nbsp; I don't know
        what numerical codes are associated with which modes.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The ATM is commanded by the computer to wind (fast forward),
        rewind, or to stop winding/rewinding with the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO15</span>,
        <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO25</span>,
        or <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO14</span>
        instructions, respectively, on the basis of the positioning of
        the ATM mode switch.&nbsp; Wind and rewind occur at about 12
        inches per second, whereas reading or writing occurs at 1.5
        inches per second.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The ATM is commanded to verify/reprogram (i.e., to output
        actual data or, I assume, to pause playback) with the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO44</span>
        instruction.</li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD33</span>
        is used to determine that the ATM has reached the proper speed
        for reading (or writing) data from (to) it, and become active
        roughly 5 seconds after the tape drive has been set in motion.<br>
      </li>
      <li>When the ATM is outputting data, the data is provided in 3-bit
        frames at a rate of 200 frames per second.</li>
      <li>A new 3-bit data frame is ready to be used when <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD41</span>
        becomes active.</li>
      <li>The 3-bit frame's data is retrieved using the commands <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD44</span>,
        <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD43</span>,
        and <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD35</span>
        to get the individual bits-positions of the frame.</li>
      <li>The end or beginning of the tape is detected with <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD34</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    The ERROR lamp seems to have been directly controlled from the ATM
    rather than from the OBC.&nbsp; The 3-bit data frames mentioned
    above were actually 4 bits each, with the 4th bit being a parity
    bit, so the ERROR lamp was lit when a parity error was
    detected.&nbsp; Moreover, the data was triply redundant as well, so
    a voter circuit could detect an error if there was a mismatch
    between the redundant data.&nbsp; Finally, the data checks occur
    even during wind/rewind operations, so the ERROR light can
    potentially be lit during those activities.&nbsp; On a similar note,
    it may have been possible to read data from the ATM during a tape
    wind/rewind operation, but I have no data on that subject.&nbsp; I
    believe that a <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">PRO14</span> will extinguish the lamp if
    it is lit.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The RUN lamp is also controlled directly by the ATM, and indicates
    that the tape is in motion; it lights 5 seconds after receiving any
    command that sets the tape in motion.&nbsp; It will be automatically
    extinguished if the beginning or end of the tape is reached.<br>
    <br>
    During an ATM search operation, the <a href="#IVI">IVI</a> was used
    to show the tape position (in 13-bit words) on the left/right
    display, and the module words on the fore/aft display.<br>
    <br>
    As far as how the data is actually encoded on the tape—i.e., how the
    3-bit frames are recombined into 39-bit memory words, and where
    those words are placed in memory—I have, as of yet, found no clue in
    the documentation.
    <h2><a name="Gemini_Assembly_Language" id="Gemini_Assembly_Language"></a>OBC









      Assembly Language</h2>
    I've given a number of examples of OBC assembly-language above,
    particularly where describing the various CPU instructions, but I'd
    like to devote this section and its sub-sections to describing the
    assembly language and its syntax a little more generally.&nbsp; I'll
    try to describe the original language used by the OBC developers to
    the extent possible, but since no documentation of the language or
    the assembler other than the names of the instructions is known to
    survive, nor any examples of OBC assembly-language contemporary to
    Gemini, you can't assume that my description is completely
    correct.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    On the other hand, my information has been gleaned from a lot of
    communications with OBC developers, and by some rather extensive
    modern (2011) recreations of sample code by OBC developers.&nbsp;
    You can find the sample code here:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Documents/Alden.doc">Sample code by OBC programmer
          Alden Minnick</a></li>
      <li><a href="Documents/Charlie.doc">Sample code by OBC programmer
          Charlie Leist</a></li>
    </ul>
    This sample code was produced with the intent of showing the coding
    style that was employed, and was developed similarly to the way that
    the original OBC code was developed: namely, by "slavishly"
    duplicating the extremely detailed flowcharts known as the "math
    flow".&nbsp; (I got the description "slavish" here from OBC
    developer Don O'Neill, who was in charge of the assembler
    program.)&nbsp; So I think that there's a pretty high degree of
    authenticity.&nbsp; On the other hand, you have to recognize that
    the sample code was developed 45 years after the end of Gemini, and
    that Alden and Charlie had (at the time of creating the samples)
    neither an assembler nor an OBC simulator, so you have to expect
    that there's going to be some degree of inconsistency and
    unavoidable error as well.&nbsp; Charlie has passed along the
    following additional brief notes that he wrote while creating his
    own code snippet that I think give a much fuller picture not merely
    of the production of the sample code, but of the method by which the
    original OBC software was produced ... not that all of the original
    developers necessarily worked the same way, of course!<br>

          Explanation of the coding method</a>.</li>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Design diagrams</span>.&nbsp;








        Charlie's sample code is supposed to be an implementation of
        page 7 of the <a href="Documents/GeminiOBC-MathFlow-III.pdf">
          1966 Catch-up &amp; Rendezvous Math Flow</a>.&nbsp; This was
        transformed into a <a

    To a certain extent, I have tried to get around some of the problem
    of having no feedback for detecting coding errors by developing a <a
      href="#yaOBCASM_the_OBC_Cross-Assembler">recreated version of the
      OBC assembler, which I call <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span></a>,
    and <a href="#yaOBC_the_OBC_CPU_Emulation">an OBC CPU emulator,
      which I call <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span></a>.&nbsp;








    At this point, these programs are very much works in progress, and I
    don't claim that they are fully debugged or even that they will run
    on your computer.&nbsp; For this reason, they have not made their
    way into the official Virtual AGC software source or binary
    distribution.&nbsp; But for now you can download the cutting-edge
    binaries from the <a href="#Downloads">temporary Gemini download
      section</a> on this page.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, before starting, let me note that in contemplating the
    original OBC assembly language, there was a small set of features
    which (from a modern standpoint) seem to be absolutely necessary to
    the language, but which don't seem to have existed originally;
    perhaps they truly existed in some form but have simply been
    forgotten over time.&nbsp; In those cases, I have taken the liberty
    of adding those features to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>
    and to the assembly-language syntax.&nbsp; In the description that
    follows, <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">I have color coded
      in this brown color any aspects of the language that seem to me to
      be newly-added and not to have existed in this exact form in the
      original OBC assembly language</span>.<br>
    <h3><a name="General_format" id="General_format"></a>General format</h3>
    The format of an individual line of code, corresponding to a single
    punch-card from the point of view of the original OBC developers or
    to a line of a source file from the current perspective, is<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;">LHS OPERATOR OPERAND COMMENT</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Note that these fields are not aligned on an particular column, and
    are simply separated by white space of any kind.&nbsp; The total
    number of characters in a line was originally limited to punch-card
    length (80 characters), as the assembler did not allow for
    continuation cards, <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">but the
      current assembler extends that limit to 132 characters.&nbsp;
      Moreover, since it's a little easier to compose source-code these
      days (without having to use punch-cards), with newly-written code
      I think it's nicer to align the columns attractively.</span><br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">LHS</span>
        an optional symbolic name for the memory address at which the
        line of code or variable/constant allocation is located.&nbsp;
        (The reason I call this "<span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">LHS</span>" is that the OBC developers
        referred to the symbolic name for a location holding a CPU
        instruction as a "left-hand symbol".&nbsp; They didn't use that
        term for names of variables or constants, though for the purpose
        of describing syntax I'll symbolize all such things as <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">LHS</span>.)









        <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">LHS</span>
        is limited to <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">8
          characters or less</span>, and may contain any character which
        is not white-space.&nbsp; I <span style="font-style: italic;">believe</span>
        that the original OBC assembler accepted only up to 6
        characters, and I further believe that the original OBC
        developers conventionally used only upper-case characters and
        digits.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153,

        They're not really "constant", though, since there's nothing to
        stop the runtime program from changing the values later.&nbsp;
        In modern terms, it's probably best to think of these as
        allocations of initialized variables.&nbsp; To my understanding,
        the OBC programmers used a naming convention in which if the
        name of the constant began with 'K', the program was not
        supposed to alter the value.&nbsp; (Interestingly, the original
        assembler did not have a concept of a symbolic constant that was
        used only at assembly time without corresponding to a memory
        location.&nbsp; The pseudo-op <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">EQU</span> which would be used for
        that purpose in many current assembly languages is, in fact,

            The word number is incremented by the assembler on each

            the selected sector and syllable are never changed until

            encountered.<br>
            <br>
            The term "module" (<span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace; font-style: italic;">M</span>)
            refers to the program modules (I, II, III, IV, V, and VI)
            that can be loaded at runtime from the <a
              href="#Auxiliary_Tape_Memory_ATM">Auxiliary Tape Memory</a>,
            thus overlaying each other.&nbsp; Module I, however, was
            intended to always be present.&nbsp; <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> allows 8 modules
            numbered 0-7.&nbsp; Module 0 corresponds to program module
            I, 1 corresponds to II, and so on.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> expects to
            assemble a complete set of program modules as a single
            operation, rather assembling the program modules separately
            and merging them afterward ... which, I gather, was the
            original procedure in Gemini itself.&nbsp; This makes it
            easier for all program modules to be aware of the same set
            of global variables. As a consequence of this feature,
            however, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>
            requires that program modules do <span style="font-style:
              italic;">not</span> redefine left-hand symbols or
            variable/constant names from one module to the next.&nbsp;
            So (for example) if you had a variable named <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">X</span>
            in module I, you couldn't define a different variable <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">X</span>
            in module II, even though you could continue using <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">X</span>
            from module I within module II, as long as module II hadn't
            actually overlaid the portion of module I where <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">X</span>
            was defined.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>
            has no way of detecting runtime problems where code or data
            are accessed that aren't actually loaded, so it is the
            responsibility of the programmer to avoid it.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            One situation that may arise is that some memory location
            may be used as a variable with two different interpretations
            in two different modules, and therefore it's desirable to
            assign two different symbolic names to it.&nbsp; For
            example, we might desire a specific address to be the
            variable <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">PHI</span> in module II and the
            variable <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">EPSILON</span> in module
            III.&nbsp; Using multiple names for the same address causes
            no problems if module II and module III use the same region
            of memory and hence don't coexist.&nbsp; In this case, the <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SYN</span>
            pseudo-op could be used to define <span style="font-family:
              Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PHI</span> and <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EPSILON</span>
            as synonyms; module II would use only the symbol <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PHI</span>
            and module III would use only the symbol <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EPSILON</span>.&nbsp;
The









            same situation could occur with left-hand symbols as well;
            for example, if there were two modules for the exact same
            area of memory, and the entry points for both were at the
            same address, then two different left-hand symbols would
            refer to the same address but in two different
            modules.&nbsp; But generally in this latter situation, the
            left-hand symbols are all defined naturally just by
            assembling the code, and therefore no explicit <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">SYN</span>
            is needed.<br>

    In the foregoing sections I've talked about the characteristics of
    the Gemini OBC itself.&nbsp; In this section I discuss simulation
    software provided by the Virtual AGC project to process OBC source
    code and emulate the OBC.&nbsp; Some of the software discussed below
    exists, but some of the description below is speculation about
    software that I <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span>
    create in the future, and how I might go about doing it. I apologise
    for that.&nbsp; Nevertheless some significant software is available
    already.<br>
    <h3><a name="Downloads" id="Downloads"></a>Downloads</h3>
    As mentioned earlier, I have created a new <a
      href="Gemini.html#yaOBCASM_the_OBC_Cross-Assembler">version of the
      OBC assembler, which I call <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span></a>,
    and <a href="Gemini.html#yaOBC_the_OBC_CPU_Emulation">an OBC CPU
      emulator, which I call <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span></a>.&nbsp;









    <br>
    <br>
    In brief, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> is a
    command-line tool which:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Reads OBC source code from a file</li>
      <li>Creates a file called yaASM.bin to hold the assembled OBC
        program executable</li>
      <li>Outputs an assembly listing to the console, where you can pipe
        it into a file<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    while <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> is a
    command-line tool which:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Reads the yaASM.bin OBC executable file created by <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span></li>
      <li>Reads the assembly listing created by <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span></li>
      <li>Emulates the behavior of the OBC CPU, so that the OBC program
        can be executed<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    More-detailed explanations are available in the sections
    specifically devoted to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> below, but at its
    most basic, here are the commands you'd use to assemble the test OBC
    assembly-language source-code file, using sample OBC code provided
    in the file Test.obc, and then run the assembled program in the
    emulator/debugger from the command-line in Windows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;">yaASM --input=Test.obc &gt;Test.lst</span><br
        style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">
      <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">yaOBC
        --binary=yaASM.bin --symbols=Test.lst</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The commands above will present you with a debugger interface in
    which you can do things like examine or modify OBC memory, set
    breakpoints, run or single-step through the OBC test program,
    etc.&nbsp; You can also view the assembly listing, Test.lst, in any
    convenient text editor you happen to have handy, such as Notepad or
    Wordpad.<br>
    <br>
    By the way, I follow the convention that OBC source files have names
    of the form *.obc, OBC executables have names of the form *.bin, and
    OBC assembly-listings have names of the form *.lst.&nbsp; These
    conventions are not enforced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>, though, and
    you're free to do as you like.<br>

      program</span> described in <a
href="Documents/GeminiCatchUpAndRendezvousAnalysisAndSimulationReport4.pdf">this









      report</a>, with the full FORTRAN source code in Appendix A of the
    report.&nbsp; The program was used by the original Gemini developers
    to verify algorithms for the catch-up and rendezvous flight
    phases.&nbsp; It is a behavioral simulation of the flight code,
    rather than being flight code itself.&nbsp; The actual flight code
    was apparently developed by handing the validated FORTRAN source
    code to programmers, who recoded it to something usable directly in
    the Gemini OBC.&nbsp; It is therefore the closest thing we have at
    the present time to actual flight code.&nbsp; The report was
    contributed by Gemini developer Eugene Mertz, and scanned by his son
    Dave.&nbsp; Thanks, Gene and Dave!<br>
    <br>
    Although the report is dated slightly after the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_7">Gemini 7/6 mission</a>,
    Gene recollects that it was actually prepared a few weeks before the
    mission, which was the first rendezvous maneuver of manned
    spacecraft.&nbsp; In other words, it's reasonable to suppose that
    the FORTRAN code corresponds to the Gemini 7/6 mission.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Gene comments, "<font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" size="2"
      color="navy" face="arial,helvetica,sansserif"><span
        style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The FORTRAN code
        seems to be complete since it had to simulate the flight
        code.&nbsp; The coding style is archaic, to say the least.&nbsp;
        Today's techniques (and newer languages) would produce better
        code!&nbsp; But, hey, the system worked to perfection despite
        problems that cropped up in equipment other than the computer
        (example:&nbsp; the plug falling out at 2 inches off the pad!)</span></font><span

        font-family: Arial;">I believe the version was FORTRAN IV since
        this was the language of choice at the time for the IBM
        7094.&nbsp; I recall one problem that we had running the binary
        deck after it sat dormant for several months.&nbsp; The problem
        arose because one of the FORTRAN programmers used an
        'undocumented instruction' that IBM decided to change to make it
        better.&nbsp; I put one chad in the offending hole and
        duplicated the deck.&nbsp; The chad stayed in long enough to
        read the 'fix' into memory.&nbsp; After that, no problem!&nbsp;
        (Also, no voting machine was involved.)</span></font>"<br>
    <br>
    Two separate application programs are actually provided, though
    using much of the same underlying machinery.&nbsp; Both a
    batch-oriented program (capable of receiving a bunch of input data
    and quickly generating corresponding output data for the mission)
    and a dynamic simulation program that operates in real-time are
    provided.<br>
    <h4><a name="Source_Code" id="Source_Code"></a>Source Code</h4>
    The source code for Report #4 described above has been extracted
    from the report and is available in the Virtual AGC software source
    tree under the directory yaAGC/GeminiCatchUpandRendezvousProgram/.<br>
    <br>
    The original program was really combined FORTRAN II and IBM
    7090/7094 assembly-language.&nbsp; <span style="font-style:
      italic;">Both</span> the original FORTRAN II and the assembly code
    did things which simply cannot be performed with any modern version
    of FORTRAN, so the original source wouldn't have been directly
    compilable and (if somehow it compiled) the executable would not
    have worked as expected on any computer other than an IBM
    7090/7094.&nbsp; The <a
      href="#Theory_of_Operation_for_the_Catch-Up_and">theory of
      operation section</a> explains some of the problems
    involved.&nbsp; Therefore, the source code in the Virtual AGC source
    tree has necessarily been modified from the original to be buildable
    and portable.<br>
    <br>
    In general, the following modifications have been made:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Every effort has been made to keep the FORTRAN source

      Catch-Up and Rendezvous Simulation Program</h4>
    In a general Virtual AGC program build, the catch-up and rendezvous
    simulation program is built automatically.&nbsp; But if you just
    want to build the Gemini simulation and none of the rest of Virtual
    AGC, you can do this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> cd
      yaAGC/GeminiCatchUpandRendezvousProgram<br>
      make<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    This requires:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>GNU <span style="font-weight: bold;">make</span></li>
      <li>GNU <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span></li>

      <li>GNU <span style="font-weight: bold;">sed<br>
        </span></li>
    </ul>
    Although the Makefile has provisions for using the earlier GNU <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">g77</span> in place of <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">gfortran</span>, but it's best not to
    use it because I've found that with <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">g77</span> the program will appear to compile but the
    executable will not be fully functional.&nbsp; If you adapt for
    other compilers, let me know the details.&nbsp; <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> At build-time, the
    Makefile dynamically transforms the FORTRAN II to a more-modern
    FORTRAN dialect (*.f → *.for), since the FORTRAN II code cannot be
    directly compiled with a modern compiler.&nbsp; This transformation
    behavior must therefore also be mimicked if changing to a different
    toolset.<br>

    The batch-oriented simulation program, referred to in Report #4 as

    simulation program, referred to in Report #4 as the "dynamic

    Neither has any command-line arguments, but both expect input files
    to be available.&nbsp; (The nature of the input files and output
    files is discussed in the next section.)<br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">BENCH7</span>:&nbsp; Receives
        input on file-descriptors 5 and 6, and outputs on

    Gene's comments: "<font size="2" face="arial,helvetica,sansserif"><span
        style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The problem is that
        there is no 'environment' FORTRAN program to generate the radar
        inputs to the OBC (range, azimuth, and elevation to the target),
        the platform inputs to the OBC (gimbal angles and
        accelerations), horizon sensor angles, and astronaut inputs
        (thrusting, switch position selections, etc.) required for a
        complete simulation of rendezvous flights.&nbsp; Without that,
        the executable just loops through the equations and logic
        waiting for dynamic inputs to arrive.&nbsp; As I recall, the
        'environment' simply had the target moving in a constant,
        'circular' orbit around an oblate Earth whose gravitational
        field was defined by a six-term series potential function.&nbsp;
        Time (one second increments) was common to both the
        'environment' and the OBC FORTRAN programs. &nbsp;I believe the
        astronaut switch inputs were originally simulated using the 7090
        (or 7094) console keys.&nbsp; Today, mouse clicks would do the
        trick.</span></font><font size="2"

        closed-loop from the OBC results using rates approximating the

    As mentioned above, the original source code from Report #4 is
    incompatible with modern FORTRAN—or indeed, any modern high-level
    computer language—in various fundamental ways.&nbsp; Therefore,

    original source in as much detail as possible, and to preserve its

      Emulation</h3>
    <h4><a name="Invoking_yaOBC_" id="Invoking_yaOBC_"></a>Invoking
      yaOBC<br>
    </h4>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> is a software-based
    emulator for the OBC CPU.&nbsp; It is simply a command-line program
    for Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X.&nbsp; It has no user-interface as
    such, except for a debugger interface which can be used to perform
    such operations as examining emulated memory, single-stepping
    through instructions, setting breakpoints, and so on.&nbsp; However,
    it can optionally be used to connect to other programs like <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span> <span
      style="font-style: italic;">(not yet available!)</span> which do
    provide a user interface; if not so connected, it simply uses the
    CPU instructions <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span> and <span style="font-family:
      Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD</span> (which would otherwise
    be used to communicate with peripheral devices) to read and write to
    a dedicated memory area separate from the regular OBC memory, and
    therefore remains usable for software debugging even without
    peripheral devices.<br>
    <br>
    The command-line syntax for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>
    is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><big><span style="font-family:
          monospace;">yaOBC [<span style="font-style: italic;">OPTIONS</span>]</span></big><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    By default, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> treats
    OBC memory as persistent, and thus to have the same contents
    whenever <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> starts as it
    had on the last occasion <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>
    stopped.&nbsp; It accomplishes this by means of an auxiliary file it
    creates called yaOBC.bin, but in order to do this effectively
    requires an orderly shutdown process by means of the debugging
    interface it provides, in order to insure that yaOBC.bin is actually
    saved.&nbsp; (More on this later.)&nbsp; However, if no such file as
    yaOBC.bin exists, it instead requires a replacement file—generally
    created by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>, since
    both programs use the same file format—to be specified by means of
    its <span style="font-style: italic;">OPTIONS</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The presently-accepted <span style="font-style: italic;">OPTIONS</span>
    are:<br>
    <br>
    --help<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Displays the available <span
        style="font-style: italic;">OPTIONS</span> and exits.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    -v<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Increases the verbosity of messages
      displayed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>.&nbsp;
      Multiple -v switches can be used.&nbsp; At present, the maximum
      verbosity that has any observable effect is "-v -v -v -v -v -v".<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --binary=<span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This specifies the name of a binary
      file containing the complete contents of memory/ATM at startup,
      along with the starting value of the HOP constant.&nbsp;
      Typically, this file would be created by <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>, but it could be a
      snapshot of the OBC system status created earlier by <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> as well.&nbsp; If
      present, it overrides the default yaOBC.bin file.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --symbols=<span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This is the name of a listing file
      produced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>.&nbsp;
      If this option is used, then it gives <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaOBC</span> knowledge of the source code and symbol
      table associated with the OBC binary being used, and allows
      symbolic debugging of the OBC program ... i.e., it allows memory
      to be inspected or modified by variable/constant name rather than
      just addresses, allows breakpoints to be put at left-hand symbols
      rather than just addresses, allows source code to be displayed
      when single-stepping or reaching a breakpoint (merely than being
      disassembled from the contents of memory), and so on.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --run<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> By default, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> starts in a paused state
      at the starting HOP constant specified by the input binary
      file.&nbsp; In other words, by default, no OBC instruction will be
      executed until explicitly commanded via the debugging
      interface.&nbsp; If the --run switch is used, it instead causes
      OBC program execution to begin in real time without further
      intervention.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --ports=<span style="font-style: italic;">Port</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Specifies the port number of a
      network socket by which additional emulation programs such as <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span> can connect to the CPU
      emulation and interact with it.&nbsp; By default, we use
      "--port=19653" ... because the first Gemini mission was in March
      1965 (in case you wondered).&nbsp; Because network sockets are
      used, peripheral-emulating programs such as <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span> can reside on entirely
      different computers from the one running <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>, as long as there's a
      network connection between them.<br>

    --method=<span style="font-style: italic;">Peripheral</span>,<span
      style="font-style: italic;">Driver</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This switch relates to the method
      by which emulated or physical peripheral devices connect to the
      emulated CPU. In essence, it allows different types of device
      drivers to be used for different <span style="font-style: italic;
        font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"> XY</span> ranges
      for the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span>
      and <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD</span>
      instructions of the CPU.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style:

        style="font-style: italic; font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;"> XY</span> range by the designator of a
      specific peripheral device, as follows:<br>

        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Peripheral=</span>ALL
          applies the Driver choice to the complete <span
            style="font-style: italic; font-family: Courier

        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Peripheral=</span>TRS</li>
      </ul>
      The <span style="font-style: italic;">Driver</span> field
      specifies the the data-transport method for the <span
        style="font-style: italic; font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;"> XY</span> ranges associated with <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Peripheral</span>, as follows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>MEM, meaning that there is no emulated or physical
          peripheral of type <span style="font-style: italic;">Peripheral</span>,
          and so <span style="font-family: Courier
            New,Courier,monospace;">PRO/CLD</span> are simply supposed
          to read/write to a special memory buffer maintained by
          yaOBC.&nbsp; This choice would typically be used when doing
          pure debugging OBC software.</li>
        <li>SOCK, meaning that a network socket (as with the --ports
          switch described above) are used.&nbsp; This choice would be
          used for emulated peripherals provided directly by the Virtual
          AGC project, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span>.</li>
        <li>COM1, COM2, etc., meaning that the RS232 port or
          USB-to-RS232 converter converter designated as COM1, COM2,
          etc., is used.&nbsp; (Note that these are designations used by
          Windows and not by Linux or Mac OS X, so in those cases you
          need to additionally use one or more of the --com1, --com2,
          ..., switches described below to link designations like COM<span
            style="font-style: italic;">n</span> to an actual comport as
          understood by those operating systems.)&nbsp; This choice
          might be used (for example), if you had constructed a physical
          simulation of an MDIU or IVI.</li>
        <li>CUSTOM, meaning that a custom driver (of a type not
          otherwise supported by Virtual AGC) is used.&nbsp; This choice
          would be used if you were doing something I didn't know how to
          help you with or had not otherwise envisaged.&nbsp; In
          particular, I think this is the method that would be used to
          interface yaOBC to the Orbiter spacecraft-simulation system.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The default is
      "--method=ALL,MEM".&nbsp; Note that regardless of the driver type,
      all <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO/CLD</span>
      ends up in the memory array, so all drivers ultimately build atop
      the MEM driver.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --io=<span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> When the MEM driver (see --method
      above) is used, the dedicated memory area used for emulating the <span
        style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO/CLD</span>
      instructions defaults to being all zeroes at startup, or else is
      populated with values from the preceding run of <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>.&nbsp; It's possible
      instead to load that area with different values using the --io
      switch.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span>
      represents a simple ASCII file that can be created in any text
      editor.&nbsp; The file has 128 lines, each of which is of the form
      "PRO <span style="font-style: italic;">yx value</span>" or "CLD <span
        style="font-style: italic;">yx value</span>".&nbsp; The first 64
      lines are for <span style="font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span> and the last 64 are for <span
        style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLD</span>.
      Each of the two areas is in YX order: 00, 01, 02, ..., 77.&nbsp;
      So while it may <span style="font-style: italic;">appear</span>
      that you can rearrange the lines of the file however you like, you
      actually cannot: the "PRO <span style="font-style: italic;">yx</span>"
      and "CLD <span style="font-style: italic;">yx</span>" portions of
      the lines are present simply to make it easier for you to know
      which <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span> is which,
      but cannot actually be changed and only the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">value</span> fields should be
      edited.&nbsp; The easiest way to get such a file to edit is to
      start from the yaOBC.io file of a prior <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaOBC</span> run, since such a file is automatically
      created when <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> shuts
      down.&nbsp; (This is the file which is loaded, if it exists, at <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> startup unless
      overridden by --io.)&nbsp; You can also manually create such a
      file during a <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> run
      via the COREDUMP command debugging interface as described below.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --com1=<span style="font-style: italic;">ComportName</span>, --com2=<span
      style="font-style: italic;">ComportName</span>, etc.<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Optionally used with the --method
      switch.&nbsp; The defaults are "--com<span style="font-style:
        italic;">N</span>=COM<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>",








      but those defaults are meaningful only in Windows.&nbsp; On Linux,
      the comport names are generally one of the following
      instead:&nbsp; /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, ..., /dev/ttyUSB0,
      /dev/ttyUSB1, .....&nbsp; So in Linux, you'd need switches like
      "--com1=/dev/ttyS3", "--com2=/dev/ttyUSB1", and so forth,
      depending on your setup.&nbsp; I don't know what they're typically
      called in Mac OS X, but they'd be /dev/<span style="font-style:

    <h5>General Information About the yaOBC Debugger<br>
    </h5>
    The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> debugging
    interface is a method of controlling, examining, or altering the
    emulation process at runtime by entering textual commands from a
    command-line.&nbsp; The debugging interface is always present,
    whether or not you choose to use it.&nbsp; By default, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> starts in a paused state,
    so that the emulation won't even start unless you manually start it
    with (for example), the debugger's RUN command; however, you can
    override this behavior and start <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>
    in a running state by using its "--run" command-line switch.&nbsp;
    If you do the latter, and if there are physical or emulated
    peripheral devices attached to the the CPU, you never need to use
    the debugging interface at all.&nbsp; Conversely, if you have no
    attached peripheral devices, you can never observe the behavior of
    the emulation unless you use the debugger.<br>
    <br>
    At startup in a paused state, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>

        debugger paused&gt;</span><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    It may not look exactly like this, but I'll describe some of what's
    here just to give you the general idea.&nbsp; The first line shows
    the values of various CPU registers:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>HOP register, in octal form.&nbsp; The HOP register is also
        parsed into its constituent parts, namely the address ("0-<span
          style="font-style: italic;">Sector-Syllable-Word</span>") and
        half-word-mode bit.&nbsp; The leading "0-" is present, because
        the debugger always includes the program module in the address,
        but that field isn't present in the HOP register and hence will
        always be 0.&nbsp; The "VAL" that's shown in the example above
        is the 13-bit octal value stored in the memory location pointed
        to by the HOP register.&nbsp; If that location happens never to
        have been written to either by the assembler or the emulated
        program, it will have the illegal value 77777.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Accumulator, in octal form.</li>
      <li>PQ register, in octal form.&nbsp; The PQ register is used for
        forming results of <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>
        operations, and in the real OBC had the property that the
        results weren't valid for several machine cycles after the
        operation started.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>
        makes the result available immediately, but implements a small
        countdown timer that is set to a non-zero value when the
        multiplication or division commences and counts down by one for
        every instruction thereafter until a value of 0 is
        reached.&nbsp; In other words, while the results become
        available immediately, they wouldn't have been valid in a real
        OBC until the counter reaches 0.&nbsp; It's the value of that
        counter that's shown as "TMR" above.</li>
    </ul>
    The second line shows the total number of instructions executed so
    far, and the amount of real time those instructions would have
    taken.&nbsp; Realize that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>
    cannot maintain the exact timing of 140 μsec. of the original OBC,
    since even though the computer on which it is running is far, far
    faster than the OBC, it is nevertheless not an embedded system and <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> must share resources with
    other software running on the computer.&nbsp; So <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> merely tries to maintain
    the same average instruction rate in a manner that's hopefully
    transparent to the user.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances, the total
    time listed by the debugger should correspond closely with the
    actual real time consumed, except when the emulator is explicitly
    commanded to run the emulation faster or slower than real time.<br>
    <br>
    The third line shows the source code of the line at which the
    emulation is currently paused.&nbsp; This source line is taken from
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> listing file,
    where available, in which case it will be include left-hand symbols,
    show the operand by name, and show comments.&nbsp; If the listing
    file is not available, or the location is somehow absent from the
    listing file, what will instead be shown is a disassembly of the
    current location, which in the case of this example would be:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;">0-00-2-000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; CLA&nbsp; 400</span></div>
    <br>
    Another interesting factoid about source-code lines is that since
    the complete OBC software consists not only of program modules
    loaded into main memory, but also program modules residing on the
    ATM but not yet loaded, the source-code line associated with any
    given address in memory is ambiguous: several different program
    modules may use the same addresses for different purposes and
    associate different source code with them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the
    debugger has no way of knowing which program modules are loaded or
    are associated with which addresses.&nbsp; So it tries to match the
    value stored at the address with the value that each of the program
    modules think should be stored at that address, and then displays
    the first source-code line that actually matches.&nbsp; But this
    method can still be wrong and the wrong source-code line could be
    displayed sometimes.&nbsp; The address printed with the source line
    will show the module which the debugger thinks the source line is
    from (for example "1-00-2-000") even though the code is actually
    being run from main memory ("0-00-2-000") rather than from the ATM
    directly.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, the fourth line is the debugger's prompt, and which is
    where commands you input would appear.&nbsp; If <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> starting in a running
    state instead of a paused state, you'd have <span
      style="font-style: italic;">only</span> this prompt, and wouldn't
    have any of the other three lines.&nbsp; (By the way, any user input
    to the debugger discards anything from an '#'&nbsp; character to the
    end of the line.&nbsp; This isn't of much interest under normal
    circumstances, but can be useful if input is piped into the debugger
    from the command line from a prewritten script, since it allows the
    addition of comments to such scripts.)<br>
    <br>
    When the emulation is in a running state, <span style="font-style:
      italic;">any</span> command (legal or illegal, or even just
    hitting the Enter key) at the debugger prompt will pause the
    emulation.&nbsp; The emulation remains paused until commanded
    otherwise.<br>
    <h5>Commands Recognised by the yaOBC Debugger<br>
    </h5>
    The commands which can be entered at the prompt are the
    following.&nbsp; Items in brackets (like so: [<span
      style="font-style: italic;">Stuff</span>]) are optional.&nbsp; The
    commands themselves are not case-sensitive.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>HELP or MENU or ? — display a list of available commands.</li>
      <li>QUIT or EXIT — exits <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>,
        saving the current state so that the emulation can be resumed
        from where it stopped if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>
        is run again later.&nbsp; Resuming the emulation exactly is
        really only feasible if using the MEM driver (see --method
        switch above) for peripherals, because a physical or emulated
        peripheral will have its own internal state not necessarily
        accessible or controllable by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>RUN or CONT or R — stop pausing and begin running the
        program.&nbsp; The program will then run until encountering one
        of the following conditions, in which case the emulation will
        again pause:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Reaching an instruction having a breakpoint</li>
        <li>Modifying a memory location having a watchpoint</li>
        <li>Encountering an illegal runtime condition such as executing
          past the end of memory</li>
        <li>Detecting user input from the debugger prompt</li>
      </ul>
      <li>STEP [<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>] or NEXT [<span
          style="font-style: italic;">N</span>] or S [<span
          style="font-style: italic;">N</span>] or N [<span
          style="font-style: italic;">N</span>] — executes the next <span
          style="font-style: italic;">N</span> assembly-language
        instructions.&nbsp; If <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>
        is omitted, then it defaults to 1.&nbsp; As a convenience, if
        the <span style="font-style: italic;">previous</span> command
        was STEP/NEXT/S/N, then simply hitting the Enter key without
        inputting any command at all will do a "NEXT 1", so you can
        simply advance through the program step-by-step by repeatedly
        hitting the Enter key.&nbsp; The Enter key by itself has no
        effect if the previous command was something other than
        STEP/NEXT/S/N.<br>
      </li>
      <li>BREAK <span style="font-style: italic;">Location</span> — set
        a breakpoint at a memory location, CPU register, or PRO/CLD <span
          style="font-style: italic;">YX</span>.&nbsp; <a
          href="#Location-Field_Parsing_by_the_Debugger">See the section
          below on parsing the <span style="font-style: italic;">Location</span>
          field</a>. Notice that a breakpoint can be set not only at an
        instruction, but also at locations containing data (thus
        corresponding to what some debuggers call a "watchpoint").&nbsp;
        The behavior of a breakpoint is that it pauses emulation
        whenever the debugger detects one of the following two
        conditions:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The next instruction to be executed would come from a
          location marked with a breakpoint; or</li>
        <li>The next instruction would access a data-location marked
          with a breakpoint.&nbsp; The exact meaning of "access" depends
          on the global WATCHMODE setting (see below).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <li>WATCHMODE <span style="font-style: italic;">Mode</span> —
        This global setting determines what kinds of accesses of a data
        location trigger a break.&nbsp; The behavior of breakpoints for
        code locations is not affected.&nbsp; The choices for <span
          style="font-style: italic;">Mode</span> are:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>ANY&nbsp; —&nbsp; Trying either to read or write the data
          location with the breakpoint triggers a break.</li>
        <li>WRITE — Trying to write the data location with the
          breakpoint triggers a break.</li>
        <li>CHANGE — (Default) Trying to <span style="font-style:
            italic;">change</span> the value stored at the data location
          triggers a break.&nbsp; For example, writing 0 to a location
          already containing 0 would not trigger a break, but changing
          it to 1 would.&nbsp; This concept only applies to memory; for
          breakpoints on registers or PRO<span style="font-style:
            italic;">YX</span> or CLD<span style="font-style: italic;">YX</span>,
          <span style="font-style: italic;">Mode</span>=WRITE is used
          even if CHANGE is selected.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>BREAKPOINTS — display all currently-defined breakpoints.<br>
      </li>
      <li>DELETE [<span style="font-style: italic;">Location</span>] —
        delete the breakpoint from the designated <span
          style="font-style: italic;">Location</span>, or delete all
        watchpoints and breakpoints if no <span style="font-style:
          italic;">Location</span> is specified.&nbsp; <a

        easily cause memory locations to be loaded with values that make
        no sense contextually at all, such as loading the HOP register
        from a variable.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Value</span>
        is one of the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An octal number if it has a leading 0 and consists entirely
          of octal digits.</li>
        <li>A decimal number if it consists entirely of decimal digits,
          an optional decimal point, and optional leading plus- or
          minus-sign.&nbsp; Also:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is no decimal point, then the value is treated as
            an integer and is stored as-is.</li>
          <li>If there is a decimal point, then the value is scaled to
            have absolute value less than 1.0 but to retain the maximum
            possible number of significant bits—i.e., so that the
            most-significant bit other than the sign bit is 1 unless the
            value is exactly 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>An existing left-hand symbol, in which case the value is
          assembled as a HOP constant formed from that left-hand symbol.</li>
        <li>An existing variable-name or constant-name, in which case
          the value is <span style="font-style: italic;">the value
            stored in that variable or constant</span>.</li>
        <li>An address of the form "<span style="font-style: italic;">Module-Sector-Syllable-Word</span>",









          in which case a HOP constant is formed with the half-word mode
          flag reset to 0.&nbsp; (The value of <span style="font-style:
            italic;">Module</span> is ignored, since the OBC HOP
          constant has no field associated with it.)</li>
        <li>An address of the form "H-<span style="font-style: italic;">Module-Sector-Syllable-Word</span>",









          in which case a HOP constant is formed with the half-word mode
          flag set to 1.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>COREDUMP <span style="font-style: italic;">Filename</span> [<span
          style="font-style: italic;">IoFilename</span>] — creates a
        snapshot file of the OBC into the file <span style="font-style:
          italic;">Filename</span>.&nbsp; The snapshot contains all
        memory and CPU registers.&nbsp; These snapshot files can be
        loaded into yaOBC at startup via the --binary command-line
        switch.&nbsp; Optionally, if <span style="font-style: italic;">IoFilename</span>
        is present, the dedicated memory areas which the MEM driver (see
        the --method switch) uses to emulate the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PRO/CLD</span>
        instructions will be written out as well, and can be reloaded
        into yaOBC later with the --io command-line switch.&nbsp;
        However, this will have little or no effect in recreating the
        states of the peripheral devices if drivers other than MEM are
        used.</li>
      <li>ATM <span style="font-style: italic;">Module</span> — Loads a
        given program module from ATM into memory.&nbsp; Only values in
        the range 1-7 are sensible.&nbsp; <a
          href="#Treatment_of_Program_Modules_by_the">See the
          program-modules section below</a>.&nbsp; What this command
        does is to overwrite all of main memory, but only for those
        addresses in which the selected <span style="font-style:
          italic;">Module</span> has an initialized value —i.e., an
        instruction or a constant.&nbsp; Variables and unused memory
        locations are not initialized by the assembler, so any contents
        of main memory at such locations remain intact.&nbsp; Other than
        ignoring uninitialized locations, there is no provision for
        loading subsets (such as restricted address ranges) from <span
          style="font-style: italic;">Module</span> into main memory.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Notice that while no way is provided to directly do something like
    jump to a given location and begin executing there, you can
    indirectly achieve that by doing things such as "EDIT HOP <span
      style="font-style: italic;">ExistingLeftHandSymbol</span>" and
    then "RUN".<br>
    <h5><a name="Treatment_of_Program_Modules_by_the"
        id="Treatment_of_Program_Modules_by_the"></a>Treatment of
      Program Modules by the Debugger</h5>
    The assembler, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>,
    expects to assemble a complete set of program modules as a single
    operation, and hence the binary file loaded by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> contains not only the
    contents of main memory but also the contents of all program modules
    on the ATM but not yet loaded into main memory.&nbsp; This is why
    the debugger treats full addresses as being of the form "<span
      style="font-style: italic;">Module-Sector-Syllable-Word</span>".&nbsp;
A









    numbering system is used in which <span style="font-style: italic;">Module</span>=0









    corresponds to Program Module I, <span style="font-style: italic;">Module</span>=1









    corresponds to Program Module II, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    However, this idealized numbering scheme pertains only to the
    situation immediately after assembly and before any ATM modules have
    been loaded into main memory, because the debugger really interprets
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Module</span>=0 as being "the
    contents of main memory" and not merely as Program Module I.&nbsp;
    Therefore, as time progresses and various program modules are loaded
    from ATM into main memory, <span style="font-style: italic;">Module</span>=0








    becomes a mashup of not only Program Module I, but also a lot of
    other program modules as well.&nbsp; However, <span
      style="font-style: italic;">Module</span>=1-7 will always continue
    to be the pure contents of ATM.<br>

    for this field in all cases, whether or not all possibilities
    necessarily make sense for all commands.&nbsp; The <span

    the following:<br>

    <h4><a name="Protocol" id="Protocol"></a>Communications Protocol for
      yaOBC</h4>
    If, perchance, you are familiar with the socket protocol use for
    Apollo-related software provided by the VirtualAGC project, such as
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, etc., you'll find the
    protocol and external tools used for the Gemini-related software
    very different.&nbsp; There's no particular reason for this, other
    than present convenience for me, though the new method does have
    some points in its favor as compared to the old.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    As mentioned above, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span>
    supports both network sockets or comports (RS-232, USB) for
    connecting the emulated CPU to emulated or physical
    peripherals.&nbsp; The protocol I envisage is basically the same in
    either case, and is as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Messages are 7-bit ASCII text.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For comports, messages are delimited by a line-feed (LF) or
          carriage-return (CR) character, and empty messages are
          discarded.&nbsp; Therefore, software can terminate messages
          using newline characters from any of the major computing
          platforms (CR-LF for Windows, CR for Mac, LF for Linux/UNIX)
          without affecting the interpretation of the message by its
          receiver.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">(If anyone
            was really going to use this for comports, it might be
            worthwhile to add CRC to the ends of the messages.&nbsp; I'm
            not going to worry about this for now, since at the moment I
            visualize it as extra complexity for a usage case that's not
            terribly likely.)</span><br>
        </li>
        <li>For sockets, messages are interchanged via <a
            href="http://enet.bespin.org/index.html">the cross-platform
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">enet</span> library</a>,
          and are "packets" as understood by that library. CR or LF
          terminations are not expected to be present within the
          messages.&nbsp; In this situation, the CPU emulator <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> acts as an <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">enet</span> server listening on
          the port defined by its command line switches (defaulting to
          "--port=19653), while peripheral emulators such as <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span> act as <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">enet</span> clients connecting on
          the defined port.&nbsp; I also provide a utility program (<span
            style="font-weight: bold;">enetHost</span>) which can be
          used either as a client or server, and hence can be used for
          debugging or experimenting with the interface.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>The following message types are defined:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"R <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span>" is a message
          in either direction between the peripheral and CPU; if the CPU
          receives the message from a peripheral, it relays it to all
          peripherals.&nbsp; The message is a command to adjust the
          passage of emulated time with respect to real-time by factor <span
            style="font-style: italic;">X</span>, with <span
            style="font-style: italic;">X</span> being a floating-point
          number.&nbsp; If <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span>==1.0








          (the default at startup), then emulated time is nominally
          identical to real time.&nbsp; If <span style="font-style:
            italic;">X</span>==2.0, then emulated time progresses twice
          as fast as real time, and so on.&nbsp; If emulated time is
          paused (for example, while OBC execution is paused at a
          debugger prompt), then <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span>==0.0.</li>
        <li>"S <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>" is a message
          from the server to peripherals, instructing them to
          synchronize their internal timers to a nominal value of count
          <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span> (decimal).&nbsp;
          The synchronization is merely nominal, because it may need to
          be adjusted for the delays in sending and interpreting the
          command itself, and because the software's grasp of time is
          only nominal anyway.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>
          is actually the current number of OBC instructions executed by
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> since startup,
          and during debugging operations like single-step (when "R 0.0"
          is in effect), the "S" message is updated after every
          instruction.&nbsp; When "R 0.0" is not in effect, an "S"
          message is sent to any newly-connected peripheral, but "S"
          messages are sent only at several-second intervals thereafter.<br>
        </li>
        <li>"D<span style="font-style: italic;">YXB C</span>" is a
          message from a peripheral emulator to the CPU emulator which
          provides the current state of a discrete input.&nbsp; In this
          case, <span style="font-style: italic;">Y</span> and <span
            style="font-style: italic;">X</span> are octal digits which
          are the same as would be used in a <span style="font-family:
            Courier New,Courier,monospace;">"CLD <span
              style="font-style: italic;">YX</span>"</span> CPU
          instruction, while <span style="font-style: italic;">B</span>
          is either 0 or 1.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>
          is the timestamp (see the "S <span style="font-style:
            italic;">C</span>" command above) at which the data is
          valied.&nbsp; These messages are sent asynchronously, whenever
          the peripheral wishes to change the state of the input.&nbsp;
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> buffers the
          message appropriately, and only makes the result available to
          the CPU's actual CLD instruction when the appropriate
          timestamp <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span> is
          reached.&nbsp; If <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>
          is 0, it is interpreted as the current time and the data is
          used immediately; this feature is primarily intended for
          debugging using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">enetHost</span>
          program mentioned above, and shouldn't be used by the CPU or
          peripherals in most cases.<br>
        </li>
        <li>"P<span style="font-style: italic;">YX D C</span>" is a
          message in either direction between the peripheral and the
          CPU, representing a <span style="font-family: Courier
            New,Courier,monospace;">"PRO <span style="font-style:
              italic;">YX</span>"</span> CPU instruction input in one
          case and an output in the other.&nbsp; <span
            style="font-style: italic;">D</span> is a set of up to 9
          octal digits representing the data and <span
            style="font-style: italic;">C</span> is the timestamp at
          which the data is valid.&nbsp; These messages are sent
          asynchronously, and the receiving device is supposed to buffer
          it until the time indicated by the timestamp has been
          reached.&nbsp; If <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>
          is 0, it is interpreted as the current time and the data is
          used immediately; this feature is primarily intended for
          debugging using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">enetHost</span>
          program mentioned above, and shouldn't be used by the CPU or
          peripherals in most cases.</li>
        <li>"A <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>" (comports
          only) is a message in either direction to repeat all messages
          from timestamp <span style="font-style: italic;">C</span>
          onward, and would presumably be used in case a corrupted
          message had been detected.&nbsp; <span style="font-style:
            italic;">(I don't intend actually implementing this
            until/unless somebody asks me for it, since I don't
            presently think that comports are a likely usage case.)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <li>The full set of messages which need to be sent over new
        connections between the CPU and peripherals is presently
        TBD.&nbsp; I'm not sure that there is any good answer to this
        question. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
        </span></li>
    </ul>
    For example:&nbsp; Part of the process of downlinking telemetry data
    is outputting a data word via <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">"PRO 10"</span> to the <a
      href="#Downlink">Instrumentation System</a> (IS).&nbsp; For the
    sake of argument, we'll suppose that the word in the accumulator is
    octal 123454321, and that the <span style="font-family: Courier
      New,Courier,monospace;">PRO</span> instruction will be the 666'th
    instruction executed.&nbsp; The message emitted by the CPU is "P10
    123454321 666".<br>
    <br>
    The optional usage of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">enetHost</span>
    program is very simple:&nbsp; To start a server, do "enetHost
    --server"; only one server can be running on any given port, so if <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> or another instance of <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">enetHost</span> is running on the same
    port, this operation will fail.&nbsp; To start a client, just
    "enetHost" (or "enetHost --client", if you prefer).&nbsp; Up to 32
    clients can connect to one server, as presently configured.&nbsp;
    The switch "--port=<span style="font-style: italic;">PortNum</span>"
    can be used to select a port other than the default 19653.&nbsp;
    Message data which is supposed to be sent is accepted on stdin,
    without any supplemental data.&nbsp; Received-message data is output
    on stdout, accompanied by some helpful information:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A leading field consisting of the number of characters in the
        message.</li>
      <li>A field uniquely identifying the sender of the message, by IP
        address and dynamically-assigned port number.</li>
      <li>The message itself is in double-quotes.</li>
    </ul>
    Additional information of a less-useful nature, like information on
    connects and disconnects, user prompts, and so on, is output on
    stderr.&nbsp; In theory, one could construct a Gemini peripheral
    emulator from a language with no bindings for the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">enet</span> library, such Tcl/Tk or
    some other interpreted language, by using <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">enetHost</span> as a backend and redirecting/interpreting
    stdin/stdout/stderr appropriately.<br>
    <h3><a name="yaOBCASM_the_OBC_Cross-Assembler"
        id="yaOBCASM_the_OBC_Cross-Assembler"></a>yaASM, the OBC
      Cross-Assembler</h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> has been discussed
    above quite a bit, but a few unexplored details remain.&nbsp; This
    program is presently functional for OBC, though not necessarily
    debugged or tested.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> is an assembler for
    Gemini OBC assembly language files, outputting a binary executable
    suitable for being used with <a href="#yaOBC_the_OBC_CPU_Emulation"><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span></a> simulation
    software.&nbsp; The assembly language for OBC is as <a
      href="#Gemini_Assembly_Language">defined above</a>.<br>
    <br>
    By convention, but not by any requirement of the assembler, Gemini
    OBC source-code files have the filename extension .obc.&nbsp; This
    convention arises from the existence (or potential existence) of
    CPU-specific syntax highlighters when viewing such source
    code.&nbsp; The assembler does not care what the filename extensions
    are.<br>
    <br>
    Note that at present, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>
    simply aborts with an error message upon the first source-code error
    it detects.&nbsp; I personally don't like that behavior—I'd like to
    get a complete list of all errors—but I may or may not be too lazy
    to ever change it.<br>
    <br>
    The command-line syntax for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>
    is as follows<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><big><span style="font-family:
          monospace;">yaASM [<span style="font-style: italic;">OPTIONS</span>]
          --input=<span style="font-style: italic;">SourceFilename
            &gt;OutputListing</span></span></big><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The assembled executable binary is always put into a file called
    yaASM.bin.<br>
    <br>
    The presently-defined <span style="font-style: italic;">OPTIONS</span>
    are:<br>
    <br>
    --help<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Displays the available <span
        style="font-style: italic;">OPTIONS</span> and exits.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --hwm<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Equivalent to putting the directive
      <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HALF</span>
      at the top of the input source file to set half-word mode.&nbsp;
      The default is <span style="font-family: Courier
        New,Courier,monospace;">NORM</span> to set normal mode
      instead.&nbsp; The --hwm switch (or lack thereof) can be
      overridden by the directives within the source file itself.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --code=<span style="font-style: italic;">M-</span><span
      style="font-style: italic;">PP-S-WWW</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Equivalent to putting the directive
      "CODE <span style="font-style: italic;">M-</span><span
        style="font-style: italic;">PP-S-WWW</span>" at the top of the
      input source file.&nbsp; The default for OBC is "CODE
      0-00-2-000".&nbsp; Can be overridden by the directives within the
      source file itself.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --data=<span style="font-style: italic;">M-</span><span
      style="font-style: italic;">PP-S-WWW</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Equivalent to putting the directive
      "DATA <span style="font-style: italic;">M-PP-S-WWW</span>" at the
      top of the input source file.&nbsp; The default for OBC is "DATA
      0-00-0-000".&nbsp; Can be overridden by the directives within the
      source file itself.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The format of the binary output file is as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The binary file consists of a sequence of 16-bit integers.</li>
      <li>Most of the output integers contain a 13-bit syllable, aligned
        at the least-significant bit of the 16-bit word.</li>
      <li>The output words are ordered so that the first word is for
        syllable 0 of address 0 of sector 0 of module 0.</li>
      <li>Successive output words increment first the word number (0 to
        255) next the syllable number (0,1,2), then the sector (0 to
        15), then the module number (0 to 7).</li>
      <li>At the end are the following additional 32-bit integers:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The contents of the HOP register.&nbsp; The starting HOP
          constant defaults to 0-00-2-000 with HWM=0, as far as <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span> is concerned, but
          can be changed within the source code:&nbsp; Just make sure
          there's a constant named OBCENTRY defined like "<span
            style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">OBCENTRY
            HOPC LHS</span>", where LHS is an existing left-hand symbol
          for where you want the program execution to start.</li>
        <li>The contents of the accumulator register.&nbsp; This is
          always 0 for files created by <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">yaASM</span>.</li>
        <li>The contents of the PQ register (which is what's accessed by
          the instruction <span style="font-family: Courier
            New,Courier,monospace;">SPQ</span>).&nbsp; This is always 0
          for files created by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span>.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    There's no attempt by the assembler to make this binary file
    portable to other computers, so if you assemble such a binary file
    on a computer with a little-endian format (such as so-called 'x86
    CPUs have) and try to emulate it on a computer with a big-endian
    format (such as PowerPC), or vice-versa, you will find that it
    doesn't work.&nbsp; However, if you stay within the 'x86 family of
    computers, there should be no problem passing such files around
    among Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X computers at will.<br>

      Control Panel Emulation</h3>
    Unlike the Apollo spacecraft (plural), the Gemini spacecraft had a
    simple enough control panel that it makes sense to simulate the
    complete control panel on a single computer screen.&nbsp; Of course,
    since we won't simulate all of the Gemini peripherals, many of the
    controls and readouts won't be functional.&nbsp; <a
      name="yaMDIU_the_MDIU_Emulation" id="yaMDIU_the_MDIU_Emulation"></a>Recall








    that the MDIU comprises the MDR readout unit and the MDK keypad
    unit, as seen in the photo at right, to provide a simple display and
    keypad interface to the OBC.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
      yaPanel</span> software would provide a simulated MDIU interface
    to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaOBC</span> simulated-OBC
    software ... if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span>
    existed.&nbsp; Right now, it's merely a fairly-distant gleam in my
    eye.<br>
    <br>
    Operation of the OBC via the MDIU follows a simple set of
    conventions, as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Command/data entry into the computer is performed by entering
        a 7-digit string of numbers.</li>
      <li>The first two digits are an "address" (01-99), and the final
        five digits are a "message" (octal or decimal, depending on
        context).&nbsp; Note that the MDR has a 7-digit readout, which
        is parsed into a 2-digit field followed by a 5-digit field.</li>
      <li>The digit '9' serves a dual purpose, in that if it is the
        leading digit of the 5-digit message field it is treated as a
        minus-sign.</li>
      <li>If the astronaut makes a data-entry error in using the MDIU
        (see the procedures listed just below), the MDR display shows
        all 0 to indicate that an error occurred.</li>
      <li>When entering digits, pressing the CLEAR key on the MDR will
        erase all of the digits so that entry can be restarted.</li>
      <li>When entering digits, it's necessary to wait until a digit is
        displayed before entering the next digit.&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Control of the OBC via the MDIU is very similar to control of the <a
      href="yaAGS.html">Apollo AGS via its DEDA</a>.&nbsp; Here are the
    operations which can be performed by the astronaut using the MDIU:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The astronaut can control the OBC by inserting data into OBC
        memory addresses using the MDK and MDR.&nbsp; The procedure for
        doing so is as follows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the CLEAR button on the MDR.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Enter 7 digits using the numerical keypad on the MDK.&nbsp;
          The first two digits are the address, and the last five digits
          are the data.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Press the ENTER button on the MDR to actually perform the
          operation.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The astronaut can verify data previously stored in the OBC as
        follows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the CLEAR button on the MDR.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Enter just the 2 address digits on the MDK.</li>
        <li>Press the READ OUT button on the MDR.</li>
        <li>The requested data will be displayed and updated at
          half-second intervals.</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>

      341px;" align="right" width="605" hspace="10" height="341">The
    relationship of the "addresses" 1-99 to actual physical memory
    addresses is TBD.&nbsp; (There is no reason logically why they can't
    map to any 99 memory locations.&nbsp; However, for efficiency of
    coding, it's reasonable to suppose that they were actually
    contiguous.&nbsp; It's also reasonable to suppose that they resided
    in the residual sector, so that they could be immediately accessed
    by code in any memory sector.)<br>

      <li>The COMP light—lit while the computation is in progress.</li>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span> also provides some
    simulated control-panel indicators related to the Time Reference
    System (TRS), which relate to passage of real time rather than being
    controlled by the OBC.&nbsp; These displays include three separate
    clocks and a stop-watch function.&nbsp; We don't provide a simulated
    TRS as such, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaPanel</span> is
    obviously aware of the passage of real time, and consequently it can
    provide these simulations itself.&nbsp; The operation of these
    simulated devices should be pretty self-explanatory.<br>

        As you will have noted if you've read this far, there are some
        pretty serious gaps in the publicly-accessible data about the
        Gemini computer and its software.&nbsp; If you know where to
        find any more information, please tell me about it.&nbsp;
        Examples of some of the things that would be interesting to have
        include:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Source code, source code, source code.&nbsp; Any computer
            source code—or for that matter, binary code—that ran on the
            Gemini computer would be useful:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Flight software.</li>
            <li>Preflight software.</li>
            <li>Test &amp; checkout software.</li>
            <li>Even sample code.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Manuals explaining the syntax of Gemini assembly-language.</li>
          <li>Any documents missing from the <a href="links2.html#OBC">Document









              Library</a>.</li>
          <li>Developers' notes.</li>
        </ul>
        Another interesting possibility is to locate a tape from the
        Gemini Aux Tape Unit.&nbsp; Since the Aux Tape Unit was used to
        load software for some mission phases in flight, it is possible
        such a tape could still hold actual executable OBC software.<br>

                        worked on the Gemini project at IBM in Owego,
                        NY, and Bethesda, MD, from about 1962 through
                        1968, basically from the beginning to the end of
                        the project, and was responsible for the
                        in-orbit software applications of the onboard
                        computer system.&nbsp; The Gemini software team
                        was organized by function (ascent, rendezvous
                        and in-orbit navigation, and reentry).&nbsp; My
                        responsibilities encompassed the rendezvous and
                        in-orbit, autonomous navigation functions.&nbsp;
                        Our rendezvous group consisted of five
                        people:&nbsp; two analysts, two simulation
                        programmers, and one on-board computer
                        programmer.&nbsp; The other groups were
                        similarly organized.<br>

                        small-town public fear that something bad was
                        about to happen soon. &nbsp;I'm not sure we

                        The series expansion was verified and derived by
                        a number of analysts at IBM, other contractors

                        As I recall, the values of the constants were
                        determined by tracking satellites that were
                        already in orbit.&nbsp; The constants were to
                        change from time to time but finally settled
                        down to those selected in the OBC.</span></font><font

                        All equations were checked and re-checked by
                        project members several times to be sure they
                        were accurate.&nbsp; Some equations were adapted
                        to the in-orbit Autonomous Navigation
                        function.&nbsp; Many computer hours were
                        expended on IBM mainframes (7090/7094)
                        simulating all mission aspects to "man-rate" the

                      mainframe Fortran simulator had a converter that
                      allowed plugging in the actual Gemini flight code
                      to replace the Fortran version in the 7094
                      simulation.&nbsp; This, of course, was used to
                      check the actual flight code for closed-loop
                      timing or other problems.&nbsp; A Mylar punched

                      itself (except for the programs that were stored
                      on the Auxiliary Tape Unit) prior to launch.&nbsp;
                      I recall a situation where the tape reader was
                      lifted up the outside of the launch tower,
                      connected to the Gemini computer (which was
                      already installed in the spacecraft), and a
                      program fix loaded to correct a radar hardware

                      started out with FORTRAN II running on the 7090,
                      but when our computer was upgraded to the 7094, I
                      believe we quickly switched to FORTRAN IV.&nbsp;
                      IBM was never shy when they pushed for adopting
                      standards.&nbsp; After all, if their version of
                      the standards was adopted, they had a foot in the
                      door.&nbsp; The switch from FORTRAN II to FORTRAN
                      IV occurred, but it could have been as early as
                      1963-64, in time for Gemini 7/6.&nbsp; Our
                      facility was always on the forefront of
                      technology.&nbsp; I don't recall the exact date of
                      the switchover.&nbsp; The version used for the
                      catch-up and rendezvous simulation program could
                      have been FORTRAN II.&nbsp; The key is whether or
                      not there are no "machine-dependent features"
                      included in the listing.&nbsp; I can't tell for
                      sure.&nbsp; I know we used punched cards for
                      loading the program, a 1401/1403 for printing, and
                      a special plotter on the "other side of the wall"
                      to show relative trajectories.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp;
                      What power. [<span style="font-style: italic;">Ed.:








                        There are machine-dependent features, it seems,
                        so the program must either have been FORTRAN II

                      beginning to learn things about the Gemini memory
                      I wish I had known in the 1960s.&nbsp; For
                      example, after many divide instructions were
                      executed in a row (I don't know how many), the
                      memory cores heated up and you would get the wrong
                      answer in the accumulator. &nbsp;This problem was
                      controlled by inserting a no-op instruction
                      between the divides, thus keeping the cores cool
                      enough to always give the right answer.&nbsp;
                      Wow!&nbsp; If I had known this, maybe I would have
                      structured the guidance equations
                      differently.&nbsp; But we had smart OBC
                      programmers who could figure out ways to get
                      around hardware problems, both in the OBC and in
                      external equipment (such as the on-board
                      radar).&nbsp; There were lots of lessons learned
                      in the early days of space flight.&nbsp; And there
                      wasn't much time to spend figuring out how to fix
                      problems.</span></font><br>

                      knowledge) by the company to develop a digital
                      computer to fly men into space.&nbsp; The memory
                      device, the same as was used in OAO, was designed
                      basically for collection of data from the
                      telescope, storing it until it could be sent via
                      telemetry to a ground station.&nbsp; No real

                      station using a MiniTrack Mark II
                      installation.&nbsp; I am the middle figure, and to
                      the left and right are L. Passage and K. Watson,
                      respectively.&nbsp; To my knowledge, they were not
                      involved in Gemini.&nbsp; The right-hand photo
                      shows a partially completed half of the antenna,
                      which consisted of two 8-dipole arrays spaced 500
                      feet apart.&nbsp; It was all, including frequency
                      converters, etc., constructed by hand by
                      volunteers.&nbsp; Yes, that is snow on the ground.
                      The photos were taken about four years prior to
                      the Gemini project (following the first successful
                      launch of Vanguard 1 on March 17, 1958).&nbsp; We
                      worked together on some terrestrial projects in
                      the 1950s.&nbsp; Many of us were members of the
                      radio club, K2ERQ, and we tracked sightings for
                      Echo (100-foot Mylar balloon) and other
                      satellites.&nbsp; The tracking program was written
                      in FORTRAN by unknown persons at Brown
                      University.&nbsp; We ran the program on an IBM 650
                      computer (drum machine, probably FORTRAN I).&nbsp;
                      I believe the club's interest in satellite
                      tracking and space in general announced that the
                      company was ready, willing, and able to enter the
                      space development.&nbsp; At least, we believe so
                      (according to club lore).</span><small><br>

                        tape with punched holes that contained the

                                    interesting thing about the DIVide
                                    instruction is that the answer was
                                    only available to the memory
                                    location specified by the SPQ
