These source-code files are part of a reconstructed copy of Luminary 69/2,
the flown, final release of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) software. 
<br><br>
The reconstruction is based on the source code of Luminary 69 &mdash; i.e., the
initial, unflown version, "revision 0" &mdash; of which 
a contemporary listing was available.  The code was then updated by incorporating the 
differences between Luminary 69 and Luminary 69/2, known from other contemporary
documentation.  The only such difference is the implementation in 
Luminary 69/2 of the "R-2 Lunar Potential Model", the source code for which was taken 
from program Luminary 99/1 (Apollo 11 LM), of which a contemporary listing was also available.
Finally, the now-reconstructed Luminary 69/2 was then validated by assembling it to
executable form and verifying that its memory banks had the correct checksums,
known from still other contemporary documentation.
<br><br>
Note that page numbers in the reconstructed code match those in the original Luminary 69
program listing, or in the ORBITAL INTEGRATION log section, in Luminary 99/1. Page numbers 
would certainly differ somewhat in a contemporary Luminary 69/2 listing.
Moreover, annotations that were not present in the contemporary source code have been added 
to the reconstructed code to justify each change in Luminary 69/2 relative to 
Luminary 69. Here's a guide to the Apollo documentation referenced in those annotations:<br>
