<h2><a name="mess"></a>Your Software Repository Is a Mess!</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>That's not a question, and nobody ever asked it.&nbsp; But they may
 as well have, since I was noticing the other day that after 20+ years 
of collecting this material it has become an enormous repository of 
buried treasure.&nbsp; Emphasis on the "buried".&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc">I'm speaking, of course, of our GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp; So let's take a very brief tour of what's in it.<br>
  </p>
  <p>First, what you see by default when you go to the link for the repository is the <i>master</i>
 branch.&nbsp; The master branch is really where all of the complexity 
is, so I'll get to it in a moment.&nbsp; But there are also a number of 
alternate branches you can choose to look at.&nbsp; Those aren't as 
complex as the master branch, so let's get those out of the way first.<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Branch: <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/schematics">schematics</a>.&nbsp;
 This contains electrical schematics for the AGC, the DSKY, and various 
other components of the Apollo guidance system, as transcribed for 
computer-aided design (CAD).&nbsp; You don't get your choice of CAD 
systems, though.&nbsp; The files are for the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>
 system, because it's open-source and available everywhere.&nbsp; (I've 
endeavored to make these CAD drawings as visually similar as possible to
 the original schematics as humanly possible.&nbsp; But if you insist on
 having them, scans of the original schematics are available too, but 
not in the software repository; you'll find them instead on <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://archive.org/details/virtualagcproject">our Internet Archive site</a>.&nbsp; But with 100K or so scans, it's a bit of trouble finding things there, too, so you should instead approach them via <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="ElectroMechanical.html">our website's Electromechanical Page</a>.)</li>
    <li>Branch: <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/mechanical">mechanical</a>.&nbsp;
 This contains 3D models some of the Apollo guidance-system components, 
particularly the DSKY, in case you feel like 3D-printing them.</li>
    <li>Branch: <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/gh-pages">gh-pages</a>.&nbsp;
 This contains the master HTML files, imagery, and so on for the Virtual
 AGC website, including this very page you're reading now, not including
 the vast number of huge PDF files for the website's documentation 
libraries.&nbsp; The actual website is a copy of these master files plus
 the documents for the library, although you can browse <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://virtualagc.github.io/virtualagc/index.html">the master site directly at GitHub</a>, if you have some reason to do so.</li>
    <li>Branch: <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/scenarios">scenarios</a>.&nbsp; This contains setups for various Apollo missions, for the NASSP add-on to the Orbiter spaceflight simulator.</li>
    <li>... and many branches not likely to be of any concern to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As for the master branch, it contains software source code, and 
lots of it.&nbsp; The following list isn't exhaustive, but it covers 
most of the folders in the master branch.<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Original flight and development software:</i><br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) software for various missions and engineering purposes</i>.&nbsp; Each version has its own separate folder, and you may need to look at our <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Colossus.html">Colossus</a> or <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Luminary.html">Luminary</a> website pages, or <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/links2.html#AssemblyListings">our document library</a>,
 to know which versions are of interest.&nbsp; Look in the folders with 
names like these (with the * indicating a variable version 
number):&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Artemis*</li>
        <li>Aurora*</li>
        <li>Borealis* (not actually original; we wrote it)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Colossus*</li>
        <li>Comanche*</li>
        <li>Corona*</li>
        <li>LMY*</li>
        <li>LUM*</li>
        <li>Luminary*</li>
        <li>Manche*</li>
        <li>Retread*</li>
        <li>Skylark*</li>
        <li>Solarium*</li>
        <li>Sunburst*</li>
        <li>Sundance*</li>
        <li>Sundial*</li>
        <li>Sunrise*</li>
        <li>Superjob*</li>
        <li>Trivium*</li>
        <li>Validation* (not actually original; we wrote it)</li>
        <li>Zerlina*</li>
        <li>Rope-Module Dump Library:&nbsp; This folder contains dumps 
made from AGC core-rope memory modules, rather than source code, mostly 
for the AGC versions listed above.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>AGC software-development tools:</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>YUL (assembler)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>Apollo Abort Guidance System (AGS) software</i>.&nbsp; Again, each version has its own folder, with names like: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>FP*.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>Apollo Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) software</i>.&nbsp;
 In general, you will not be able to find LVDC flight software in the 
repository at present, due to ITAR-related fears.&nbsp; As for 
non-flight software:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>PTC-ADAPT-Self-Test-Program (for the ground-test panel known as the PTC)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>Gemini:</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>GeminiCatchUpandRendezvousProgram.&nbsp; Flight software for
 the onboard computer remains unavailable.&nbsp; This is a Fortran II 
program used for ground simulation, intermixed with some C files by me; 
but I never was able to make it work</li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>Space Shuttle flight software (PASS, BFS)</i>:&nbsp; Not presently available in the repository, due to ITAR fears.</li>
      <li><i>Space Shuttle development software:</i></li>
      <ul>
        <li>yaShuttle/Source Code/PASS.REL32V0.&nbsp; A cross-compiler

    <h2><a name="Whats_Up_With_the_Logo"></a>What's Up With the Logo?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you're sharp-eyed enough, and visit here often enough, you
        might notice that the logo seems to change from time to
        time.&nbsp; Well, for many years, I exclusively used the logo<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="ApolloPatch2.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></div>
      <p>which is a common version of one of the (I guess) official NASA
        Apollo patches that I simply downloaded from somewhere.&nbsp;
        But not everybody was happy with that design, for one reason or
        another, and eventually Eugene Dorr (thanks, Gene!) designed a
        whole bunch of alternative patches that could be used as our
        logo.&nbsp; Even after I had whittled the choices down to 4 and
        had canvassed other folks' opinions and factored in my own
        preferences, I basically couldn't figure out any clear favorite
        among them.&nbsp; So in the end I wimped out, and the website
        just cycles through the top 3 choices on a day-to-day
        basis.&nbsp; Since this website is in the public domain, you're
        free to use these designs yourself if you like (again, thanks
        Gene!).&nbsp; Here were the top 4 candidates, and the website
        uses all but the 2nd one from the left:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="ApolloPatchA.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"><img src="ApolloPatchB.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"><img src="ApolloPatchC.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"><img src="ApolloPatchD.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"><br>
        <div align="left"><br>
          As I say, though, there were lots of other designs as well,
          and if anybody grovels hard enough — oops, I mean "lobbies" —
          I'll put them someplace for your inspection.<br>
        </div>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote> </blockquote>
    <h2><a name="Is_this_site_mirrored_anywhere_"></a>Is this site
      mirrored anywhere?<br>
    </h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">As far as I know, not any
      longer.&nbsp; The only mirror I knew of seems not to have been
      updated since 2010.<br>
      <br>
      Mirroring, of course, entails downloading of our entire website
      onto your own server.&nbsp; But realize that just mirroring the
      main website doesn't get you any of the material at our
      supplemental GitHub and Internet Archive sites <a href="#Why_Does_it_Say_ibiblio_All_Over_these">mentioned earlier</a>.&nbsp;


















      And even if you've separately made local copies of that material,
      none of the hyperlinks to GitHub or The Internet Archive in your
      local copy of our website will actually point to your local copies
      of the GitHub or Internet Archive material anyway.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      With that said, if you were to download our entire ibiblio site to
      (say) a thumb drive, you could still certainly get a lot of great
      offline use out of it, since other than the GitHub or Internet
      Archive links, it doesn't need an active server and is designed to
      be used entirely offline.&nbsp; (In fact, you'd have access to
      almost anything you might need, except for our tens of thousands
      of electrical and mechanical engineering drawings.)&nbsp; A tool
      such as 'wget' works well for this on Linux or Mac OS X.<br>
      <br>
      Just for fun, here are some of the site statistics as of
      2019-05-11:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Our main (ibiblio.org) website:&nbsp; 27GB.</li>
        <li>Our GitHub repository:&nbsp; 276MB<br>
        </li>
        <li>Our Internet Archive project:&nbsp; 144GB</li>
      </ul>
      Big!&nbsp; Though to be fair, The Internet Archive creates a lot
      of extra files in alternate formats, so we probably really only
      uploaded about half of the amount quoted above.<br>

    <h2><a name="Privacy_concerns"></a>Privacy concerns?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This website collects no data about you of any kind.&nbsp; It
        does not send data about you anywhere.&nbsp; It uses no
        cookies.&nbsp; It saves no data in your local browser's storage
        area.&nbsp; It uses no analytics.&nbsp; It serves you no
        ads.&nbsp; It seldom loads 3rd-party libraries, and of those
        uses only controlled copies of the libraries.&nbsp; It is almost
        entirely pure HTML, but does use a small amount of javascript to
        make sure that the banners at the tops of the pages appear
        correctly, that you can use the search engines, and that you can
        hide information that's too old (if you choose to do so) on the
        change-log page.&nbsp; In short, we couldn't care less about
        you, either as an individual or a demographic, unless you want
        to contact us directly and heap praises on us.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In fact, our main site is entirely stand-alone, and can operate
        perfectly well if you were to download the entire website onto
        (say) a USB flash drive and disconnect the internet
        entirely.&nbsp; But it would have to be a <i>big</i> flash
        drive.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Except</b> ... with that said, my comments apply only to the
        code I can control.&nbsp; There <i>is</i> a Google search bar
        at the top of every page, for your convenience in finding
        documents on this site, which admittedly can sometimes be rather
        difficult otherwise.&nbsp; Nor (obviously) does that search bar
        work without the internet.&nbsp; And the search bar <i>may</i>
        (for all I know) do a lot of the junk I just said I don't
        do.&nbsp; I'm afraid you'll have to interpret that factoid for
        yourself, applying whatever degree of paranoia you are
        personally feeling at the moment.&nbsp; Just know that if
        anything untoward is being done to you, it's Google, not me!<br>
      </p>
      <p>I will tell you, though, that we derive no revenue or other
        considerations from Google; the search bar is simply a free
        feature that they provide, and that I think is a great
        convenience for us.<br>

      <a href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/wiki">part of
        our GitHub repository</a>, and frankly its not quite good enough
      to be used for our purposes.) <br>

    <h2><a name="Is_there_a_mailing_list_for_this"></a>Is there a forum
      for this project?</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> There <i>is</i> a mailing list,
      thanks for asking!&nbsp; On the other hand, I'm told that mailing
      lists are old-fashioned, and that a newer approach would be
      something like the <a href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/discussions">"Discussions"</a>
      in our Virtual AGC GitHub repository.&nbsp; At the moment I'm
      writing this, the Discussions are completely new, so there's
      admittedly no content there, and therefore if you're interested in
      older content you'd probably need to consult mailing list after
      all.&nbsp; But <i>new</i> questions or topics would perhaps best
      be posted as a Discussion.<br>
      <br>
      As far as the mailing list specifically is concerned, if you'd
      like to subscribe, changes the preferences of your existing
      subscription, or unsubscribe, go to<br>

        I expect this to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">very</span>
        low-traffic mailing list, devoted to very technical questions,
        if my own inbox is any indication.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; However, as
        with any mailing list, you're taking your chances.&nbsp; It's a
        members-only mailing list, so hopefully you'll be spammed by it
        only if spammers spoof the email address of existing
        members.&nbsp; Also, there are various options you can set for
        your subscription, such as concealing your email address from
        the group.&nbsp; (I think I'd still be able to find out your
        email address, since I administer the list, but you'd just have
        to live with that.)<br>
        <br>
        You might also want to look at Orbiter NASSP's Virtual AGC

        more technical detail than ours do.<br>

      somewhere?</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Placing men on the moon is one of
      the greatest accomplishments of the United States of
      America.&nbsp; It is arguable, indeed, that it is the <span style="font-style: italic;">greatest</span> accomplishment (of
      any kind) in the history of the human race.&nbsp; If so, perhaps
      it makes sense to preserve the relics of the Apollo project.&nbsp;
      (Besides, I'm one of the 3. )<br>
      <br>
      I got the idea while watching the movie <span style="font-style:
        italic;">Apollo 13</span>.&nbsp; The instant in the movie where
      the AGC is powered up on Earth approach is the instant when the
      viewer suddenly feels that survival of the astronauts has changed
      from "highly unlikely" to "very probable".&nbsp; It gives me a
      chill whenever I see it.&nbsp; Anyhow, on watching this one day,
      it struck me that it was a shame nobody knew any longer how to
      operate the AGC—let alone write the programs for it.&nbsp; (As it
      happens, that thought was a bit premature:&nbsp; only 35 years had
      passed since the AGC software was written, thus many of the
      original software developers were still <span style="font-style:
        italic;">reasonably</span> young.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
      principle is correct, since <span style="font-style: italic;">very


















        few</span> people could use or program the AGC.)&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, it then occurred to me that it would be cool to bring the
      AGC back to life, and to allow anyone so inclined to use it or
      program it ... assuming, of course, that sufficient publicly
      information was available to do so.&nbsp; As it quickly turned
      out, there was enough information publicly available, though <span style="font-style: italic;">just barely</span> enough.&nbsp; The
      project turns out to be an interesting experiment in digital
      archaeology.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Later news flash:</span>&nbsp;

      It turns out, though, that the authors' literary skills didn't
      quite match their programming skills, as this quote is really from
      Henry VI, Part 2, Act IV, Scene VII.&nbsp; (Thanks to Frank
      O'Brien of the Apollo Flight Journal and Apollo Lunar Surface
      Journal for this correction.)&nbsp; By the way, if you take it
      upon yourself to actually read the play to figure out the context,
      you may find yourself reading about "a Nowne and a Verbe" rather
      than "a noun and a verb".<br>
      <br>
      Original AGC hardware developer Ramón Alonso provides a little
      more insight:&nbsp; Apparently, nobody had yet arrived at any kind
      of software requirements for the AGC's user interface when the
      desire arose within the Instrumentation Laboratory to set up a
      demo guidance-computer unit with which to impress visitors to the
      lab.&nbsp; Of course, this demo would have to <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> something, if it was going
      to be at all impressive, and to do something it would need some
      software. In short order, some of the coders threw together a demo
      program, inventing and using the verb/noun user-interface concept
      (in the whimsical fashion seen in much of this code), but without
      any idea that the verb/noun concept would somehow survive into the
      flight software.&nbsp; As time passed, and more and more people
      became familiar with the demo, nobody got around to inventing an
      improvement for the user interface, so the coders simply built it
      into the flight software without any specific requirements to do
      so.<br>
      <br>
      However, that does not mean that the verb/noun interface was
      universally beloved.&nbsp; Ramón says that <span style="font-style: italic;">many</span> objections were received
      from naysayers, such as "it's not scientific", "it's not
      dignified", or even "astronauts won't understand it".&nbsp; Even
      though the coders of the demo hadn't seriously intended the
      verb/noun interface to be used in any permanent way, it became a
      kind of devilish game to counter these objections with (perhaps)
      sophistic arguments as to why the interface was really a good
      one.&nbsp; In the end, the coders won.&nbsp; I don't know whether
      they were elated or dismayed by this victory.<br>
      <br>
      The astronauts, of course, <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span>
      understand the interface, but they did not like it.&nbsp; Most of
      them really wanted an interface much more like that they had used
      in aircraft:&nbsp; i.e., lots of dials and switches.&nbsp; Dave
      Scott is the the only astronaut I'm aware of who had kind words
      for it (or for the AGC in general), though we are told that Jim
      McDivitt wasn't necessary completely hostile to it.<br>

    <h2><a name="Why_Isnt_More_Information_Provided_"></a>Why Isn't More
      Information Provided About Why the Guidance System User Interface
      Was Like it Was?</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> A lot of thought about usability
      went into the design of the guidance system, much more so than the
      story above about verbs and nouns would indicate.&nbsp; Questions
      like what kinds of controls needed to be provided, or even <span style="font-style: italic;">where</span> those controls would be
      physically located, were extremely important&nbsp; (Thanks to
      George Silver for pointing this out.)&nbsp; Sadly, I don't know
      anything about these topics, and that's why I don't cover them
      here.<br>
    </div>
    <h2><a name="MoreAmusingStories"></a>Tell Us More Amusing Stories</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Well ... maybe just a couple more.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>The story of the 1201 and 1202 alarms on the descent by
          Armstrong and Aldrin to the lunar surface during Apollo 11 is
          well known.&nbsp; (If you don't know it, the astronauts
          received repeated alarms from the AGC of type 1201 and 1202 --
          5 alarms in all, if I'm not mistaken.&nbsp; On each alarm, the
          question was raised as to whether to continue or to
          abort.&nbsp; Obviously, they continued.)&nbsp; I'm informed
          that the representative from the MIT Instrumentation Lab who
          was present to be consulted by Mission Control was Russ
          Larson.&nbsp; When consulted on the go/no-go question, Larson
          simply gave a "thumbs up" signal.&nbsp; When asked years later
          why he had done this, he said simply that he was too scared to
          speak.&nbsp; (Thanks to Allan Klumpp for this story.)</li>
        <li>And continuing on the topic of the 1201/1202 alarms in
          Apollo 11:&nbsp; These alarms were caused by the fact that
          during the landing, both the landing radar <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> the rendezvous radar
          were turned on.&nbsp; Only the landing radar actually needed
          to be active, but it was felt by some that having the
          rendezvous radar turned on would be useful in case of a sudden
          abort.&nbsp; What wasn't known was that this extra load on the
          AGC CPU would cause it to run out of processing cycles.&nbsp;
          The software would work all right at first, but eventually the
          loss of about 15% of the CPU cycles due to processing the
          excess radar data would cause some tasks to be spawned before
          earlier instances of those tasks had completed running.&nbsp;
          Eventually, because of the duplication of tasks, the software
          would be unable to allocate the memory needed to spawn new
          tasks, and would need to restart.&nbsp; Fortunately, the
          cunning design of the software allowed the software to
          basically continue executing at the same point where it had
          been before restarting, and so it could continue operating
          normally until it ran out of memory again.&nbsp; Eldon Hall
          likes to point out that this is a <span style="font-style:
            italic;">success</span> of the AGC rather than a failure (as
          some <span style="font-style: italic;">other</span> people
          like to say).&nbsp; At any rate, Allan Klumpp coded a
          workaround for this problem in time for the Apollo 13 mission,
          but the powers-that-be declined to use the new software.&nbsp;
          Klumpp was upset enough about this to contact the mission
          commander, Jim Lovell, and describe why the new software
          (Luminary 131) would be so much better than the old.&nbsp; The
          next morning, Dick Battin dropped by Klumpp's office and
          announced, "Allan Klumpp, your political <span style="font-style: italic;">savoire-faire</span> has
          descended to a new low!"&nbsp; That was his way of saying that
          Luminary 131 would be used on Apollo 13 after all, because Jim
          Lovell wanted it.</li>
        <li>The original source code for the AGC assembler program
          called "YUL" is available <a href="YUL">here</a>.&nbsp;
          Examine (say) pages <a href="YUL/yul-0005.jpg">2</a> and <a href="YUL/yul-0006.jpg">3</a> carefully.&nbsp; I needn't
          comment further.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Not an AGC story, but I like it:&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm told that
          one of the perks of writing software at MSC (Manned Spacecraft
          Center, now Johnson Space Center) in the Apollo era was
          taking&nbsp;the coding sheets to the 'swamp' for the keypunch
          operators to build the card decks to be taken to the computer
          center.&nbsp; The 'swamp' was a tiered auditorium with many
          young women at keypunch machines on the tiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
          course, the young engineers would enter the room at the front
          at what was the focus of the tiers, feeling a little like a
          bull at the rodeo auction.&nbsp; Apparently, this was a good
          way to meet bored young women in need of stimulation.&nbsp;
          This is a case, obviously, where progress has been in
          completely the wrong direction.&nbsp; (Thanks to Paul Schlein
          for this story.)</li>
        <li>When the disks containing the Apollo 11 assembly listings
          arrived (May 2009) arrived at my office, the shipping clerk
          who handed the box to me asked if it contained a software
          update.&nbsp; I informed him that it did.&nbsp; That it was a
          very old software update ... in fact, perhaps the oldest
          software update in the history of the world.&nbsp; And you
          know what?&nbsp; I think it may actually be true.</li>
        <li>This one is not quite so amusing ... to me!&nbsp; Perhaps
          bittersweet is the proper word.&nbsp; As you have noticed from
          reading our <a href="Luminary.html">Luminary</a> or <a href="Colossus.html">Colossus</a> pages, or from various
          other comments, I (we) are rather fanatical about finding all
          of the versions of the AGC software we can, so as to fill in
          all of the blanks and be able to tell you the complete story
          of AGC software development from end to end.&nbsp; Mostly this
          involves trying to find AGC developers and Museums/Archives
          that have such software listings in their possession, and then
          shamelessly begging.&nbsp; However during the Apollo era, MIT
          Instrumentation Lab employees weren't the only people who
          routinely had these program listings.&nbsp; Another group that
          had them was the Flight Procedures Branch of the flight Crew
          Support Division at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in
          Houston.&nbsp; One member of that group, Clark Neily, had the
          following to say in response to my questioning on the matter:</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote><small>At least some of them were subtitled with the
            following Latin motto:<br>
          </small>
          <blockquote><small><i>Quod non videt oculus, cor non dolet.</i><br>
            </small></blockquote>
          <small>Does anyone among you remember this charming grace
            note, and who was responsible?&nbsp; Being the only New
            Englander in that part of MSC, and thus familiar with the
            native institutions here, I strongly suspected that the
            presence of this item in the listings was an unsubtle
            indication that at least one member of the IL development
            team had graduated from someplace like Amherst College (my
            dad's <i>alma mater</i>) rather than MIT.<br>
            <br>
            To answer your question [about other MSC members having kept
            copies of AGC listings as souvenirs], just about all of our
            inventory went over the side at the end of Apollo. I
            remember in particular a huge stack of listings in the
            hallway with a sign above saying "Free data, take one''.<br>
          </small></blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><a name="dumpster"></a>Regarding the "free data, take one"
          AGC story above, an <a href="LVDC.html">LVDC</a> developer
          told me a similar story upon hearing my complaints about a
          lack of LVDC documentation and software:</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote><font size="-1">IBM-FSD [IBM Federal Systems
            Division, which developed the LVDC] happened to build a HUGE
            fancy building in 1987 (approximately).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
            early 1990’s, NASA had one of their periodic funding
            cutbacks and reorganizations.&nbsp; Independently, IBM was
            downsizing and sold FSD to a corporation that began massive
            layouts.&nbsp; Because of the double-whammy, the “new”
            building was effectively vacated.&nbsp; I drove past it
            almost every day and observed massive amounts of
            documentation being discarded.&nbsp; A temporary ramp was
            built from the upper floors to ground-level.&nbsp; Documents
            were then shoveled from open window-areas to a lower-level
            dumpster.&nbsp; That ramp stayed in place for several
            months.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            That is likely one of the reasons why material is difficult
            to find. </font><br>

      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><small>A group of MIT engineers attended the Apollo 7 FSRR
              and made presentations, myself included. Bell Labs and TRW
              along with the various NASA Branches involved also made
              presentations. The presentations went very well and
              everything pointed to a GO for flight. After the
              presentations were completed various members of the head
              table (there were probably 50 people in the room,) in turn
              expressed their opinion based on the presentations and
              other information. When it got to the crew, backup CSM
              pilot Dave Scott spoke for the prime crew as they were at
              the Cape doing simulations. He said that in effect the
              prime crew had asked him to report that they ”had no
              confidence in the flight software”. You could have heard a
              pin drop and of course the MIT contingent was in shock.
              The meeting chairman, Chris Kraft, asked what they meant
              and asked if they were ready to fly. Dave replied
              immediately that yes they were ready to go. Kraft said, in
              so many words, that if they were ready to fly then he
              didn’t understand what they were saying. He then said if
              they weren’t ready he would replace them that minute. He
              then declared the software ready for flight.</small></p>
          <p><small>That was an unbelievable moment and it made clear
              the command of Chris Kraft.<br>

        <li>AGC developer Peter Volante contributes this story about a
          different Flight Software Readiness Review (FSRR), slightly
          edited.&nbsp; The story also happens to be about Steve Copps
          (see above), though Steve disavows any memory of the incident:</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><small>There is another story involving Steve that I recall
              from the Apollo 11 Flight Software Readiness Review (FSRR)
              The FSRR was a big deal; all the contractors involved in
              producing and testing the AGC software (Grumman , TRW, the
              Lab and others) had to make presentations and vouch that
              the software was ready for the mission. It took place in a
              big auditorium at MSC. I was sitting with Joe Saponaro and
              Gene Muller. George Cherry was introducing the Lab's
              presentation of the test results that demonstrated that
              the LEM software was capable of performing the mission
              under various conditions that might be encountered. When
              George came to the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous phase, he
              presented a single slide showing the test results for
              Rendezvous Navigation. There were a number of test cases
              reflecting different possible mission scenarios; the only
              ones I remember are one sigma and three sigma IMU errors.
              For each test case, George's slide showed the miss
              distance at closest approach, which was the figure of
              merit used to evaluate system performance. Now the amount
              of effort to get those results was substantial. I had
              worked closely with Gene and Pete Kachmar, with Joe
              supervising and helping out, for many weeks to produce all
              the data. And George had taken the heart of Gene's
              presentation (each mission phase, Descent, Ascent,
              Rendezvous, etc. was presented by the responsible
              engineer). So Gene was cringing while Joe and I were
              trying not to laugh.</small></p>
          <p><small>When George finished talking about the slide there
              was a momentary silence. Then a voice was heard asking a
              question. It was Steve. "George," he said, I notice that
              the three sigma IMU error case is better than the one
              sigma IMU error case"; that is, the miss distance with
              three sigma IMU errors was smaller than the miss with one
              sigma errors. George didn't know how to respond; he wasn't
              all that familiar with the testing. He could have said
              something about offsetting errors, but he didn't. "Well,"
              Steve continued, "do you think that's the way we should
              go?" George didn't answer and the room was silent — Steve
              had just suggested that it might be better to fly the
              mission with an inertial system with three sigma errors.
              What could anyone say?</small></p>
          <p><small>&nbsp;George was bright and enthusiastic, and made
              an indelible impression on everyone who worked with him.<br>

        <li>AGC developer Fred Martin contributes this story, though it
          perhaps needs a little explanation.&nbsp; The software in the
          AGC was partitioned up into a series of "major modes" that
          were numbered with 2-digit numbers, such as P00, P01, P02,
          etc. In particular, P00 is the "fresh start" program, the
          entry point, and isn't something you would normally use whilst
          in the midst of normal operations.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><small>While we're reminiscing I thought I'd relate the P00
              story. It was beautiful clear Sunday afternoon, Dec. 29,
              1968, and the Apollo 8 was on its way home. I had just
              deposited my family at Logan for their visit to NJ and I
              then went to the lab to be "on duty." Dan [Lickly],
              Margaret [Hamilton] and I were in the 2nd floor conference
              room reading and listening to the astronaut/Houston
              chatter when Jim Lovell said "Oh oh, I think I just did
              something wrong." The voice from Houston was calm when
              asking what he did. "I selected P00 on the keyboard. Did I
              do something?" "We'll get back to you." A microsecond
              later the phone rang from Houston wanting to know what the
              hell he did and what effect it had. We didn't know and
              said we'd get back as soon as we could. Who ever tested
              selecting POO coasting home after TEI [Trans-Earth
              Injection]? Nobody! We discussed the problem and what the
              effects might be and Dan and Margaret tore in to the
              listing to follow the thread of events. The crew had been
              taking star sightings and building their navigation base.
              The phone again ...."Well what have you come up with?
              We've got to know quickly. If the computer is out and we
              lose communications we've lost the crew. We need an answer
              now." "We're doing the best we can, we'll get back to
              you." The 8 inch listing was on the table and we pored
              over it. It was taking time. Another phone call .... more
              time. Finally, after about 90 minutes the detective work
              yielded the result. Jim had wiped out, from erasable
              [memory], all the navigation data that he had been
              collecting via the sextant. While the astronauts had
              multi-communication channels to Mission Control, the fact
              is that they would be in trouble with a loss of
              communications and no navigational information. We
              conveyed our conclusion to a very impatient Houston and
              then we heard the calm Houston voice say, "Jim, on that
              P00 we'll just up-link some data to you. Everything is
              OK." After that it was just a beautiful restful Sunday
              afternoon. No problems.</small><br>

      <ul>
        <li>And speaking of P00, a dirty little secret that you may be
          able to deduce from the story above if you are an <i>extremely</i>
          keen observer is that P00 (pee zero zero) was generally
          referred to in the AGC source code as <tt>POO</tt> (pee oh
          oh) or sometimes <tt>POOH</tt> (as in Winnie the Pooh).&nbsp;
          Now, it's not documented whether <tt>POOH</tt> is actually an
          allusion to Winnie the Pooh, or perhaps to something else, but
          one of my favorite program comments in the AGC source code
          (appearing in many different versions of the code in one form
          or another) is the following:</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>DO NOT USE ENEMA WITHOUT CONSULTING POOH PEOPLE<br>
            </tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>which is not only good advice in the AGC, but for life in
          general.&nbsp; It probably helps to know that <tt>ENEMA</tt>
          is the software function that flushes waiting programs from
          the system during a software restart.<br>

      <blockquote> </blockquote>
      A number of stories revolve around the remarkable technical
      exploits, and equally remarkable quirkiness, of the late John
      Norton of TRW.&nbsp; Though not an AGC coder himself, he had an
      important effect on the AGC coding process.&nbsp; Here's what the
      late Jack Garman had to say about him in an interview, in
      reference to the Apollo 14 mishap with the LM's
      intermittently-activating abort switch:<br>
      <blockquote><small>A fellow named John Norton, he’d be a good one
          to get hold of if you ever can, TRW in those days. I don’t
          know where he is now. He was a genius. Like many geniuses, he
          had trouble communicating with management, okay, but in the
          computer game, he was a genius. TRW had many roles in those
          days, but part of it was continuous independent assessment of
          what was going on. John’s task was to look at all the onboard
          software code and do what is today called code inspections.
          It’s a normal part of testing. It wasn’t done in those days,
          except that John Norton did it. <br>
          <br>
          The way he’d do it is, he’d take this awful assembly language
          and translate it back into his own version of a readable
          higher order language. The Norton Document, as we called it,
          that he put out for every version of every program, all typed
          by hand—no word processing in those days—was our Bible. We
          actually used it the same way somebody might use a Fortran
          listing or higher order language listing of a program to
          analyze their program. <br>
          <br>
          As soon as this happened, we opened up our Norton Documents
          and started looking for flag bits, remember, hard-coded stuff.
          The first thing we determined was that the minute the engine
          lit, the minute it lit, it would be shut down and it would
          abort, because that’s the way the computer was programmed and
          that’s hard code. It would assume that the crew just—first it
          cycles and reads it environment every two seconds, including
          all the switches, and it would read the switch and say, “Oh,
          time to abort. I’ll do exactly what I’m told,” and separate
          the descent part of the vehicle and ascent and fire right back
          into the command module. No, we don’t want to do that.</small><br>
      </blockquote>
      Tracking down these "Norton Documents" is a bit tricky.&nbsp;
      There's a notion floating around that the "Programmed Guidance
      Equations" documents (like <a href="Documents/j2-80-MSC-69-FS-4_text.pdf">this one for
        LUMINARY 1B</a>), are the Norton Documents, even though
      textually they purport to have been written entirely by MSC's
      Flight Software Branch, and barely mention TRW at all (let alone
      John Norton).&nbsp; However, they do correspond vaguely to
      Garman's description of them.&nbsp; The only hard support I'm
      aware of for this theory is the writing on the spine of this
      document in Don Eyles's collection:<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="NortonSpine.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="400">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="NortonTitlePage.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Is it a Norton Document?&nbsp; You decide.&nbsp; We don't yet have
      a scan of it, unfortunately, for reasons which escape me.<br>
      <br>
      But sometimes one had to have a bit of fun with John.&nbsp; Here's
      a story that AGC developer Steve Copps tells:<br>
      <blockquote><small>There seems to be some interest in this so I’ll
          do my best to remember back through the years. It occurred in
          1967 I believe.<br>
          <br>
          I was responsible for the crew interface to the CSM guidance
          system and strived to put together a perfect GSOP IV [Guidance
          System Operations Plan, section 4] for Apollo 7. After a
          thorough review and sign-off at the lab I sent the document to
          NASA Houston as a deliverable. I remember being proud of the
          product and more or less thought of it as my baby... I was
          young. Imagine the shock when within 24 hours after they
          received it we got a multipage memo written by John Norton
          (with the usual disclaimers) and delivered through John
          Williams, Jack Garman's boss. I couldn’t believe it. I must
          have seen it as a challenge or something because I decided
          that if John Norton could find all those faults in a day then
          I could fix them in a day. So I went at it, punching the IBM
          cards myself and submitting run after run.&nbsp; Around 5 in
          the morning I was finished and had incorporated the comments
          which were pretty much valid but for the most part were not
          substantive.<br>
          <br>
          After proofing it as best I could I decided that it would be
          fun to tease John a bit and insert a little comment which I
          assumed would take him days to find, and would make him laugh
          if he ever did find it. In the middle of P52 I wrote in tiny
          letters the words “Norton needs glasses”.<br>
          <br>
          I quickly received the approvals I needed (without telling of
          the little bomb I had inserted) and sent it off to Houston
          early with someone who was flying down. So it was in John
          William’s office that day. Within hours after receiving it
          Norton found the entry and hit the ceiling, raising hell all
          over the Center. The phones were ringing off the hooks; it
          seems everyone weighed in. I was told that Norton wanted the
          one who wrote it fired and he wanted MIT removed from the
          program. I, of course, was called to task and got to speak to
          a lot of people during the next few days.<br>
          <br>
          I was reprimanded by both my own management and by NASA
          management but in all cases with a wink and smile.<br>
        </small></blockquote>
      AGC developer Peter Volante confirms that he saw the phrase
      mentioned above, "Norton needs glasses" in a Guidance Systems
      Operations Plan (GSOP) document.&nbsp; He went on to say that a
      copy of that GSOP should be placed in the Smithsonian or some
      other museum, because the story demonstrates that a sense of humor
      is a valuable asset when working on a large program under intense
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      And speaking of Peter, here's my transcription of a memo he sent
      me, which Norton had apparently fired off to Jack Garman in 1971,
      in response to some later hiccup:<br>
      <blockquote>
        <div align="left"><small>Subject:&nbsp; "Norton is Working With
            Us"<br>
            <br>
            I received a call this morning from a John van Ecckel, whom
            Monroe identified as somebody in "crew coordination".&nbsp;
            He said that he had been talking to C. Thomas about the
            Users' Guide Material.<br>
            <br>
            He said that he had talked to R. Larson of MIT, and Larson
            had informed him that "Norton has been working with us the
            past couple of weeks on updating the Users' Guide."<br>
            <br>
            With the millions of dollars that you give to MIT, it seems
            to me that they should be able to produce documents on their
            own, rather than having to drag my name into their excuses
            to NASA as to why the document is lousy.&nbsp; As Mr. Larson
            craftily planned, the documents I was permitted to see had
            no page numbers and had to be returned, so I have absolutely
            no proof of whether or not some particular butch in the crew
            version was or was not in the version I saw.&nbsp; I <u>do</u>
            have proof of the Rev. 1 comments that MSC ignored in Rev.
            2, but MIT still has their millions and I still have the
            post-midnight hours.&nbsp; As I told you yesterday, I've
            been working for 6 years on Apollo, and NASA doesn't have
            much to show for it.&nbsp; I hope <u>you</u> sleep well.</small><br>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      Personally, I laughed and laughed when I read this, so I naturally
      raised the question as to whether John had, perhaps, been making a
      little joke when he wrote this.&nbsp; I was told "I wouldn't say
      John had a sense of humor.&nbsp; That message was not a
      joke."&nbsp; I don't know, though; does anyone really say
      "craftily" unless they're trying to be funny?<br>
      <br>
      And speakings of the millions of dollars NASA was giving to MIT
      (as opposed to John Norton, I suppose), here is an amusing aside
      about Norton from MSC's Clark Neily:<br>
      <blockquote><font size="2" color="black" face="arial,helvetica,sansserif">Norton was under contract to
          my group at MSC in Flight Procedures Branch of the Flight Crew
          Support Division. He was quite a phenomenon. He would have a
          detailed report in our office the day after the release. His
          reports and the flow charts were used to assure that the
          part-task procedures simulators were functionally identical to
          the LGC software, even though [the simulators were] programmed
          in FORTRAN IV (extended). Also I understand [he] drove TRW HR
          crazy because he didn't cash his pay checks for months at a
          time. I once stood behind him at the Clear Lake Savings and
          Trust and he had a sheaf of them in his hand...</font></blockquote>

      the stuff the simulation can do is so trivial?</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> It takes more than just a computer
      to fly an Apollo LM or CM.&nbsp; At the very least, you need
      simulations of the spacecraft's IMU, AOT, and of the physical
      spacecraft (i.e., acceleration, torque, fuel usage, etc.).&nbsp;
      Maybe we'll have those things, one of these days.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      <a href="yaTelemetry.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span></a>
      module has made a good start towards providing some of these
      things.<br>

      the Simulation<br>
    </h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Various things to to look out for
      are found in the <a href="download.html#Some_platform-specific_odditities">quirks
        list</a>, but here's a separate, supplemental list just to make
      it even more confusing:<br>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're running the simulation by separately running <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> rather than through
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI,
        remember that the two programs have to be run from two different
        command-line windows.&nbsp; A reason why you might <span style="font-style: italic;">want</span> to do this is that on
        some slow Win32 systems, there are some timing problems if the
        startup scripts are used.<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> enforces a
        certain ordering in the way the various components of the
        simulation start up.&nbsp; If you bypass <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, you should note
        that there some are some quirks in the startup and shutdown
        ordering of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>.&nbsp; If you <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> stick to my
        recommended ordering, you will probably encounter
        problems.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">In Win32</span>:&nbsp;
You


















        can't start peripherals before you start <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>; if you do, the
        programs will not be able to communicate amongst
        themselves.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">In Linux
          (pre-20050131)</span>:&nbsp; You can't terminate <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> before terminating
        peripherals; if you do, there will be a timeout (which may be a
        minute or two) before the operating system allows the port
        connecting the simulated CPU and peripherals to be reused.&nbsp;
        (In Win32, command "<span style="font-family: monospace;">netstat


















          -a</span>" --- or in Linux, the command "<span style="font-family: monospace;">netstat -a | grep 19697</span>"
        --- is useful for detecting this condition.)&nbsp; The
        startup/shutdown procedure I'd recommend for both platforms is:<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Start <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.</li>
        <li>Start all peripherals (like <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">yaDSKY</span>).</li>
        <li>Use to your heart's content.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Stop all peripherals (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>).</li>
        <li>Stop <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Startup of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
        component, which is written in the Tcl/Tk scripting language,
        has always been problematic:&nbsp; If it doesn't connect within
        a certain limited time, it will abort, and if the simulation is
        being run from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
        GUI it will generally cause the entire simulation to
        abort.&nbsp; One thing that seems to help is to delay startup of
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> for several
        seconds, to insure that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
        is up and waiting for connections before <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> even tries to
        connect.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The main place (I think/hope) where things could go wrong
        would be in the TCP socket interface connecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>.&nbsp; If some other
        service on your computer was already using port 19697—if, for
        example, you were simultaneously running two copies of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>—then there could be a
        problem.&nbsp; You can check this by closing out all instances
        of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDKSY</span> (in Win32 with
        ctrl-alt-del, or in Linux with "<span style="font-family:
          monospace;">killall -KILL yaDSKY</span>" and "<span style="font-family: monospace;">killall -KILL yaAGC</span>"),
        and then trying this:&nbsp; "<span style="font-family:
          monospace;">telnet localhost 19697</span>".&nbsp; If telnet
        says it connected to something, then you definitely have another
        service using this port, and you can work around it with the
        --port command-line switch of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> to choose a
        new port.&nbsp; If not, then you probably don't, and that's not
        the cause of your problem.</li>
      <li>Another possibility, I suppose, is that you may have a
        personal firewall installed which is blocking port 19697.&nbsp;
        In that case, you'll have to reconfigure the firewall.</li>
      <li>Perhaps your computer is not even set up properly for
        networking, which is necessary for any of the socket-based
        communications to work.&nbsp; For example, you may not have an
        Ethernet card.&nbsp; <a href="NoNIC.txt">These comments</a>
        from Joe Durnavich (thanks Joe!) may help if you have this
        problem and you're using Linux.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Around mid-2016, Chris Garry's Apollo 11 source-code repository
        got a lot of press, and I ended up getting some mail from
        journalists and what-not in regard to it.&nbsp; I wasn't
        involved with it, but it was a clone of the Apollo 11 AGC
        source-code files here at Virtual AGC.&nbsp; There was a brief
        flurry of activity at his repository, in which various typos in
        the text of the program comments for that code were corrected
        more quickly than here at Virtual AGC, though I doubt that
        that's the case any longer, since we ended up correcting
        literally thousands of such errors in our own Apollo 11 source
        code.&nbsp; Regardless, the attendant publicity worked out well
        in our favor, and I suspect that it indirectly resulted in us
        getting various material offered to us which we've been quite
        happy to get, from folks who might not have heard of us
        otherwise.&nbsp; At any rate, if that sounds interesting to you,

      <p>As it happens, Chris is neither the first nor the last to clone
        some or all of Virtual AGC (all of which is allowed and
        perfectly fine, of course!), and you'll find a number of them at
        GitHub.&nbsp; Though perhaps Chris was unique in discarding
        everything that wasn't directly related to Apollo 11.&nbsp; I'm
        not certain what most of the other clones are for.&nbsp; <br>

          Code</a> no longer exists other than in archival form, since

      Here are some folks who have done wacky stuff with the AGC
      (including, of course, our AGC simulation), generating lots and
      lots of media coverage in the process:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>An anonymous programmer has modified the <a href="Colossus.html#COMANCHE51">AGC Comanche 55 software</a>
          — i.e., the Command Module's AGC software for Apollo — to
          solve the "Dodge the Lasers" problem for Google's Foo.Bar
          Coding Challenge ... which is not something I had previously
          heard of, apparently because the Foo.Bar Coding Challenge is
          secret and by invitation only.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/google-foo-bar-challenge/">But










            here's a write-up of it I found online</a>.&nbsp; At any
          rate, our anonymous benefactor has provided his/her modified
          Comanche code in <a href="https://github.com/1969-07-20/Comanche055_DodgeTheLasers">a
            GitHub repository</a>, from which you can compile it and run
          it; the repository includes instructions, as well as a bit of
          a write-up of the Dodge the Lasers problem itself.&nbsp; Plus,
          there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa_WKo_Ap9Q">an









            instructional video</a>.</li>
        <li>Ken Shirriff, a member of the <a href="Restoration.html">AGC














            restoration</a> team, <a href="http://www.righto.com/2019/07/bitcoin-mining-on-apollo-guidance.html">has














            written some bitcoin-mining code for the AGC</a>, and
          provided his code for it as well (though you have to dig a bit
          to find his GitHub link to it).</li>
        <li>David Given has created <a href="http://cowlark.com/cowgol/index.html">an "Ada-inspired
            language for very small systems (6502, Z80, etc.) called
            Cowgol</a>.&nbsp; As a lark, <a href="http://cowlark.com/2019-07-20-cowgol-agc/index.html">he














            has chosen to port this language to the AGC, as well as
            writing a lunar lander game (Cowlark) for it</a>.&nbsp; In
          other words, you build the Cowlark game using a Cowgol
          "cross-compiler" on your PC, producing an AGC rope-image of
          the game software.&nbsp; When you run this rope in our AGC
          simulation — or on a physical AGC if you happen to have one
          laying around — you have a lunar lander game that runs on the
          LM's own computer!<br>

        the magazine does put a few of their print articles online, and
        that has happened (at least for the moment) with this article,

        2010.&nbsp; The title says it all.&nbsp; I think you'll find
        this to be a very readable book, somewhat like a much kinder,
        gentler form of this website in terms of the material
        presented.&nbsp; Conversely, some of the material on this
        website came from Frank originally, so I guess what goes around
        comes around.&nbsp; Good job, Frank!<br>

        interested in the stuff on my website, buy this book and read
        it.&nbsp; It's much more technical than you probably imagine
        from the title.&nbsp; I have an autographed copy, purchased from
        the author.&nbsp; The sign on the table read, roughly, "Signed
        by the author -- $50.&nbsp; Unsigned -- $55."&nbsp; (And no,
        that's not a misprint.&nbsp; Either price was a bargain compared
        to amazon.com, so I cleverly bid it up to $60.)&nbsp; Also, you

        the show (he tells us) is a half-hour film called "Computer for
        Apollo", which includes a demonstration of the AGC, as well as
        "a totally engrossing demonstration of how the AGC was

          <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
          Looking over the AGC project there doesn’t seem to be a short

          learn astrodynamics from scratch they can contact me.<br>

      <p>Looking over his résumé, I find that Charles has degrees in
        physics and electrical engineering, has worked at places such as
        Martin Marietta (Shuttle ground systems) and Boeing Hunstville
        (Space Station), and has been an adjunct professor at the

      <p>Charles also points out that MIT has posted online course
        materials, including lecture notes, from <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/16-346-astrodynamics-fall-2008/">a
          course that Richard Battin gave on this very subject in 2008</a>.&nbsp;




        The posting doesn't have enough information in it to
        unambiguously say whether or not this is the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Battin">Richard
          Battin</a> from the original team at the MIT Instrumentation

    <h2><a name="Is_the_moon_landing_a_hoax"></a>Is the moon landing a
      hoax?</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Yes, though I've removed all
      references to the hoax from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> source
      code.&nbsp; (Joke!)&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      But seriously, I've found the blog of some thinker who has used
      the existence of our Virtual AGC project itself as <span style="font-style: italic;">evidence</span> that the moon
      landing was faked.&nbsp; His reasoning goes as follows:&nbsp; a)
      Virtual AGC simulates some Apollo hardware; b) therefore, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">possible</span> to simulate Apollo
      missions; and c) therefore Apollo missions <span style="font-style: italic;">were</span> fake 40 years ago.&nbsp;
      Well, you hardly need Virtual AGC as a step in that reasoning,
      since lots of people already know that the astronauts trained
      extensively in simulated spacecraft.&nbsp; The simulators being
      used in the 1960s and 70s were far better and more accurate than
      our 21st-century software-only simulations.<br>
      <br>
      Amusingly to me, the Virtual AGC project has <span style="font-style: italic;">also</span> been used as a
      counter-argument to those who believe in the hoax theory, so I
      guess the pluses and minuses of our project, hoax-wise, tend to
      balance out.&nbsp; I quite like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bic-z2b0mSU">a YouTube
        video</a> in which a Microsoft Windows based compilation of our
      AGC assembler (<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>) is
      performed, and then <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
      is used to assemble one of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
      or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
      programs.&nbsp; Too bad the demonstration stops short of actually
      running the simulated system.&nbsp; The video is well worth
      watching, but I'm merely giving the link for it rather than
      embedding the video itself within in this page, because there is
      an audio track that might startle those around you if you happened
      to be reading this page while on a break at your workplace.&nbsp;
      Anyway, a claim had been made that <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Luminary</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
      were not real programs, or something of that sort, and the demo
      video is supposed to debunk that by showing the the programs not
      only exist as scanned program listings, but can also be
      assembled.&nbsp; Naturally, this was not very conclusive as far as
      the believer whose argument being debunked was concerned.<br>
      <br>
      A case in point is the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/moon2/xpascal/MoonHoax/AGC/AGC.HTM">the
extraordinarily


















        detailed argument given at this link</a>, which (at least at
      this moment) includes <a href="assembly_language_manual.html">the
        totality of our own page describing the AGC programming
        language(s)</a> in a nice, scrolling box, which is flattering in
      a way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good thing I recently removed the copyright of
      our site and placed the entire content in the public domain, so as
      to keep usage like that on the legal up-and-up!&nbsp; What I take
      to be the first paragraph of the argument reads<br>
      <blockquote><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"I am
            a professional computer engineer, I have known the
            microprocessor from its start.&nbsp; I have had the
            curiosity of having a look at the Apollo guidance computer
            which has been made public.&nbsp; I have read the operator's
            manual documentation, and it's really the weirdest I have
            ever seen, so weird that it makes my hair raise on my head
            when I read it (and I have read many technical
            documentations). The program of the CM is very weird too; I
            strongly doubt it piloted anything; it could not even be
            compiled, that is transformed into machine code to be
            executed."</font></small><br>
      </blockquote>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

      that I haven't read most of the rest of the argument — the fact
      that it says in the very first paragraph that the AGC software
      can't be assembled (even though our project provides an assembler
      that assembles it) and that it couldn't possibly pilot anything
      (even though the folks over at NASSP do so regularly) causes my
      suspension of disbelief about the argument to be crumble — but it
      is very, very detailed, and uses some resources I've never seen
      before, so you may be interested in taking a look.&nbsp; Most of
      the argument seems to be that the AGC is "weird", a fact which I'm
      happy to grant, but has no bearing on anything else.&nbsp; The
      weirdness might cause the hair on my head to stand up too, if I
      had any left.&nbsp; But an aardvark or a kangaroo is weird
      too.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; They still exist.<br>
      <br>
      Nor, as it happens, are assemblers for AGC code all that uncommon,
      and mine (yaYUL) is not the only one, nor even necessarily the
      best, by any means.&nbsp; I found out recently that quite a few of
      my collaborators on this project have <i>also</i> written AGC
      assemblers, such as one called JaYUL, for their own personal
      edification.&nbsp; One of them told me something like, Ron, don't
      you know that eventually <i>everyone</i> writes an AGC
      assembler?&nbsp; I didn't, but it's good to know!&nbsp; Of course,
      at this site we now also provide the <i>original</i> YUL
      assembler used by the Instrumentation Lab until it was superceded
      by a replacement assembler called GAP.&nbsp; Admittedly, we have
      no way to actually run YUL without having a Honeywell 800/1800
      computer or a simulation thereof, so perhaps it doesn't really
      work; I suppose that pro-hoaxers can take comfort in that ... for
      the moment.<br>
