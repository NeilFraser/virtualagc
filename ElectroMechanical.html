    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction<br>
    </h1>
    <p>This page is devoted to the electrical and mechanical aspects of
      the AGC and DSKY, and more broadly, to the electrical and
      mechanical aspects of the entire Apollo CM and LM G&amp;N
      (guidance and navigation) system.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This is an ongoing effort.&nbsp; The long-range goal — or perhaps
      "wish" is a more-accurate term — is to provide the following
      engineering resources:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The complete set of engineering drawings (electrical
        schematics and mechanical drawings) for AGC/DSKY and other
        G&amp;N components, in all revisions, in the form of scanned
        images of the original Apollo Program drawings.</li>
      <li>Contemporary Apollo Program theory-of-operation documents for
        the above.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Electrically and visually accurate transcriptions of those
        electrical schematics into a modern open-source electrical CAD
        program.</li>
      <li>Accurate translation of mechanical drawings of fabricated
        parts into reusable 3D models.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Translation of AGC electrical design into Verilog
        hardware-description language or other standardized languages
        when appropriate.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Simulation of the AGC hardware, via modern open-source
        Verilog-simulation software, or other software when appropriate.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Great strides have been made toward the goal, but it nevertheless
      remains very distant.&nbsp; The far horizons grow no closer.<br>

      Drawing Number<br>
    </h2>
    To find any given drawing by its drawing number, first look in the
    "box" that covers that drawing-number range.&nbsp; Then consult the
    "miscellaneous" drawings if what you want is missing from the box or
    is illegible, or is simply too early a revision.&nbsp; The
    exceptions are mil specs (drawings with numbers like MS<i>xxxx</i>
    or NAS<i>xxxx</i>), since if we have them they'll always appear on
    the dedicated MIL-SPEC page rather than being mixed in with the
    other drawings.&nbsp; I should point out some drawings appear in the
    wrong boxes, numerically, for several possible reasons, though
    perhaps 99.9% of the drawings are numerically in the correct boxes.<br>

    <p> </p>
    In this section, the engineering drawings for the onboard Guidance
    &amp; Navigation (G&amp;N) systems in the Command Module and Lunar
    Module are provided on a mission-by-mission basis.&nbsp; Note,
    though, that there are assemblies in the engineering-drawing set
    that don't form any part of the spacecraft's onboard G&amp;N system,
    and those assemblies aren't covered in this section; an example
    would be the AGC's test set.<br>
    <br>
    Each mission had either one or two G&amp;N systems installed:&nbsp;
    one for the CM and for the LM, but of course not every mission had
    an LM.&nbsp; Each G&amp;N system is identified by a numerical
    assembly number (<a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch10Images#page/n234/mode/2up">1014999</a>
    for Block I CM, <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch4Images#page/n197/mode/2up">2014999</a>
    for Block II CM, <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n79/mode/1uphttps://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n79/mode/1up">6014999</a>
    for LM) plus a 3-digit configuration number (-000, -021, -031, ... ,
    -221) that changed from one mission to the next.&nbsp; For example,
    the Apollo 11 LM had G&amp;N system 6014999-091.&nbsp; Note, by the
    way, that we're presenting these assemblies entirely from a NASA
    perspective; changes were made to the G&amp;N system configurations
    <i>after</i> MIT/IL delivered them to NASA, and there's a completely
    different set of drawings (1015000, 2015000, 6015000) that describe
    the G&amp;N system configurations at the time they were shipped to
    NASA. MIT/IL's configuration documentation is naturally similar to
    NASA's but doesn't reflect the updates to the systems made after
    NASA had received them.<br>
    <br>
    Such a G&amp;N system is represented by a set of engineering
    drawings. Given the top-level drawings of the G&amp;N system, you
    can then look at the drawings of any of its sub-assemblies (AGC,
    DSKY, CDU, etc.), any of the drawings of the sub-assemblies of the
    sub-assemblies, and so on.&nbsp; I call this hierarchy of the
    G&amp;N system and its various subassemblies an "assembly
    drilldown". <br>

    Note that the webpages for the individual G&amp;N configurations
    linked above are generated in an automated way which additionally
    outputs a JSON representation of the hierarchical assembly
    data.&nbsp; The JSON files are not provided on this website, but you
    can use the software to generate them for yourself, or to generate
    JSON for other assemblies (such as an AGC or a DSKY by
    itself).&nbsp; This is significant because it means that you can
    load this JSON into a program, perhaps written JavaScript or Python,
    and manipulate the assembly-hierarchy data programmatically.&nbsp;
    That would allow you to do things like compute total parts counts,
    perform failure-rate analyses, and so forth ... if you have any need
    whatever to do so!&nbsp; To generate such a JSON file, you will need
    to locally clone <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/schematics">the































































































      "schematics" branch of our GitHub software repository</a>.&nbsp;
    You will also need to have Python 3 installed.&nbsp; You generate
    the JSON for a given <tt><i>ASSEMBLY</i></tt> from a command line
    by changing into the DrawingTree/ folder and running the command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldown.py <i>ASSEMBLY</i> &gt;</tt><tt><i>OUTPUT</i></tt><tt>.html</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    The <tt><i>ASSEMBLY</i></tt> name consists of a drawing number to
    which a configuration number is suffixed.&nbsp; The only allowed
    drawing numbers come from the names of the files
    DrawingTree/*.csv.&nbsp; The only allowed configuration numbers come
    from the "columns" of the .csv file (if you were, for example, to
    load it into a spreadsheet program).&nbsp; For example, the file
    2003200L.csv supports configuration numbers -011, -021, -031, -041,
    and -051, so you could generate JSON files for assemblies
    2003200-011 through 2003200-051.&nbsp; You are unlikely to want the
    output HTML file, and thus can discard it.&nbsp; The JSON is always
    output with the filename drilldown-<i>ASSEMBLY</i>.json.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, the program drilldownCompare.py is provided.&nbsp; It
    can make comparisons of two assemblies for which JSON has already
    been generated.&nbsp; For example, to compare the guidance systems
    for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 LM, you would first generate their
    JSON<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldown.py 6014999-091 &gt;temp1.html</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>drilldown.py 6014999-071 &gt;temp2.html</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    and could then use the command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldownCompare.py 6014999-091 6014999-071</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    You would find a number of differences in doing so, but perhaps the
    one that interested you most might be that assembly 2003993-031 (the
    AGC) had changed to 2003993-051.&nbsp; If you now wish to compare
    those two AGC assemblies, recall that you need to generate the JSON
    for them ... which is easy, but is a hassle.&nbsp; However, the data
    for assemblies 2003993-031 and -051 is already contained within the
    existing JSON for 6014999-091 and -071, respectively, so
    drilldownCompare.py lets you take a bit of a shortcut:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldownCompare.py 6014999-091 6014999-071 </tt><tt>2003993-031































































































        2003993-051<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    In doing this, you would find out that subassembly 2003983-021 had
    changed to 2003983-041, etc.&nbsp; The general syntax is<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldownCompare.py <i>ASSEMBLY1 ASSEMBLY2</i> [<i>SUBASSEMBLY1































































































          SUBASSEMBLY2</i>]<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <div align="left"><b>Note:</b> The rather complete assembly
      drill-down and the software tools described above were preceded by
      a set of manually-crafted partial drilldowns of just the AGC and
      DSKY, and of just their "major" assemblies and components.&nbsp;
      The last time at which those manual drilldowns were available on
      the website was at <a

      <h1><a name="LEM_Engineering_Drawings"></a>LEM Engineering
        Drawings</h1>
      <p>A digression ....<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though not strictly related to the Apollo on-board computer
        systems, nor to the larger topic of the Apollo Guidance &amp;
        Navigation System, the Virtual AGC Project is also making an
        ongoing effort to scan all available Lunar Module engineering
        drawings.&nbsp; These drawings, by Grumman Aircraft Engineering
        Corporation (GAEC) and its suppliers, almost always use the
        older acronym LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) rather than the newer
        abbreviation LM ... and since I like "LEM" better than "LM"
        myself, I'll use it whenever I'm talking about the LEM
        engineering drawings.<br>
      </p>
      <p>At present, the LEM drawings are taken mostly from National
        Archives and Records Administration Southwest aperture-card
        (i.e., microfilm) boxes.&nbsp; There are about 300 boxes of such
        drawings, nominally containing 1900 microfilm slides each, so
        there over half a million LEM engineering images!&nbsp; If you
        scroll down a bit, you'll find a huge table providing index
        pages for each of the individual LEM aperture-card boxes ...
        i.e., about 300 index pages, each providing lists of drawing
        numbers, drawing titles, and links for around 1900 scans.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But before that, even though it goes without saying, I'd
        comment that it would be tough to just wade into these hundreds
        of thousands of drawings without knowing where to start.&nbsp;
        Therefore, it's useful to know that the <i>top-level</i>
        drawings for different generations of the LEM or LTA are:<br>
      </p>

        <li>LDW280-54000 (LM-4 through LM-9?, Box 525).&nbsp; See also
          the <a href="LemDrawingMiscellaneous.html">LEM drawings from

        </li>
        <li>LDW280-60000 (LM-10 through LM-15?, Box 528).&nbsp; See also
          the <a href="LemDrawingMiscellaneous.html">LEM drawings from
            non-NARA sources</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our document library also contains some documents complementary
        to these engineering drawings that you may find useful, such as
        a few of <a href="links2.html#SystemsHandbooks">the System
          Handbooks</a>, Operations Handbooks, and Operational Data
        Books specific to these LEMs.&nbsp; At this writing, for
        example, there are the complete System Handbooks for LM-1, LM-3,
        and LM-8, and some incomplete handbooks for various others of
        the LEMs.<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>It's also worth noting that as an additional resource we've
        made a <a href="LemDrawingIndex.tsv">LEM engineering-drawing
          master-index file</a> that consolidates the indexes for all of
        the LEM boxes into a single file.&nbsp; This is particularly
        useful since drawings are often filed in the wrong boxes, for
        whatever reason, and so it could otherwise be very tricky to
        find specific drawing numbers (or drawing titles).&nbsp; You
        probably will not be able to view this (very large) master-index
        file within your browser, but you can instead download it onto
        your local computer system.&nbsp; Once downloaded, you can do
        various useful things with it, such as:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>View it as a text file.</li>
        <li>Import it into a spreadsheet program such as Excel or
          LibreOffice.</li>
        <li>Write software yourself to process the index in whatever
          manner suits you.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Anyway, without further delay, here are index pages for the
        individual LEM aperture-card boxes, to the extent that we've so
        far scanned the boxes and put them online:<br>

      <p>You may ask why there is no extensive tranche of engineering
        drawings for the CSM included?&nbsp; That's because the National
        Archives has been scanning CSM aperture cards as a separate
        effort, independent of the scanning of the LEM
        engineering-drawing aperture cards.&nbsp; Because I'm not
        involved in their scanning, I have not been able to arrange
        access to those CSM scans.&nbsp; NARA has a plan to make all of
        the digitized material available online ... someday.&nbsp;
        Whether those materials will be free of charge or not, other
        than the G&amp;N and LEM scans, I do not know.&nbsp; At this
        writing, only a fraction of the CSM cards have been scanned, and
        I wouldn't be surprised if we have to wait a long, long time to
        see them.&nbsp; So the only CSM scans presently available are
        those that were acquired from other sources.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>We do, however, have a breakdown of at least a portion of North
        American's otherwise-mysterious numbering scheme for their CSM
        drawings (to enlarge, click on on the image to the right).&nbsp;
        I say it covers only a "portion" of the scheme because it
        immediately fails to explain numbers like "V34-900001"
        referenced at the top of this section ... presumably because
        that document does not relate to a specific physical item
        installed in the CSM.&nbsp; But this chart comes from North
        American's much-more-extensive "<a
          href="Documents/apollo_electrical_installation.pdf">Apollo
          Electrical Installation</a>" manual, which has additional

    These documents are theory-of-operation documents, which describe
    the circuits textually and often provide useful information like
    timing diagrams of what the circuits do.&nbsp; In the process of
    providing this info, though, they provide the schematics themselves
    as figured embedded within the text.&nbsp; In saying that the
    schematics provided in the theory-of-operation documents are
    "essentially complete", what I mean is that the schematics in these
    volumes aren't precisely in the form of the original drawings, but
    rather have been redrafted by AC Electronics to fit into the format
    of their volumes.&nbsp; Thus, they are subject to mistakes (and
    potentially, corrections) by AC Electronics, and cannot necessarily
    be straightforwardly matched to specific drawing numbers or
    revisions.<br>
    <br>
    Surprisingly, while we have schematics in one form or another for
    all AGC/DSKY modules, though not necessarily in all of the different
    forms or versions we like, and we have wiring diagrams for the DSKY
    backplane into which its modules are inserted, we do <i>not</i>
    have wiring diagrams for the AGC backplane.&nbsp; (See <a
      href="#Basic_Partitioning_of_the_AGC">this section</a> for a
    discussion of how the AGC circuitry is partitioned up.)&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, we do have enough information about it to be useful,
    compiled by two techniques:&nbsp; Firstly, the electrical schematics
    for the individual circuit modules list "net names" for all of the
    connector pins going from the module to the backplane, so we do know
    how the modules were interconnected on the backplane; secondly,
    physical AGCs can have their backplanes mapped by means of
    continuity checking with an ohmmeter.&nbsp; Mike Stewart has put
    together <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/agc_hardware/blob/block2/delphi.db">a
      helpful sqlite database</a> and <a
      href="http://apolloguidance.computer/pins">an interactive, online
      form of it</a>, based on mapping out the backplane for AGC s/n 14.<br>

    Besides the AGC Handbook, additional information used for
    cross-referencing the various drawings to specific AGC or DSKY part
    numbers and/or serial numbers came from a couple of sources:<br>

    <p>The <a href="#Browse_by_Drawing_Number">index pages</a> and <a
        href="TipueSearch.html">search engine</a> for engineering
      drawings are organized by <i>drawing number</i>.&nbsp; Most of
      the G&amp;N drawing numbers (from MIT/IL, AC Electronics,
      Kollsman, etc.) are 7-digit numbers.&nbsp; Block I drawings
      generally have numbers like 10<i>xxxxx</i>, while Block II
      drawings generally have numbers like 20<i>xxxxx</i>, although
      other drawings (such as Specification Control Drawings, SCDs) are
      also mixed into that numbering system as 10<i>xxxxx</i> numbers as
      well.&nbsp; Drawings for military specifications, from North
      American, from Grumman, and so on, use other numbering systems.<br>

      and is presented as a single scanned image.&nbsp; However, there
      are more-complicated cases as well, in which case a single drawing
      number might be represented as several or even as many, many
      scanned images:<br>

      <li>Drawings usually advance through several revisions, beginning
        with "-", and progressing through "A", "B, "C", and so on.&nbsp;
        If there are more than "Z" revisions, then you might see
        revision codes like "AA", "AB", "AC", and so on.&nbsp; For
        example, one drawing in the index goes up to revision
        "DK".&nbsp; Some letters in the alphabet were not used for
        revisions ("I", "O", "Q", "X").<br>
      </li>
      <li>Sometimes a drawing has multiple physical pages, called
        "sheets".&nbsp; A 3-sheet drawing, therefore, might appear in
        the index as three separate scans.</li>
      <li>Most of our drawings were preserved as "microforms" attached
        to "aperture cards" ... which means that a photograph was taken
        of each sheet, and the photographic negatives were stored (and
        eventually scanned) in place of the original paper
        drawings.&nbsp; But if the original sheet was physically larger
        than approximately an E-sized sheet of paper (44"×34"), it was
        too large to be captured by a single photograph.&nbsp;
        Therefore, it was photographed instead as a set of 2, 3, or 4
        "frames", with frame 1 usually being the leftmost frame. &nbsp;
        In those cases each scanned image is really a frame of a sheet,
        rather than an entire sheet.&nbsp; Of course, today, we could
        digitally process a set of scanned frames, and instead produce a
        single image for each sheet.&nbsp; Perhaps that will be done for
        our collection someday; presently, it has not been done for the
        drawings indexed here, though it has been done for a subset of
        them elsewhere on this site, when there has been a specific need
        to do so.</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Most</i> (but not all) of the scans in the collection were
    captured from aperture cards (held permanently at the U.S. National
    Archives).&nbsp; Aperture cards are computer punch cards, into which
    a photographic negative has been attached.&nbsp; The punch card
    itself encodes metadata about the negative, such as its title, the
    total number of sheets, the specific sheet number, the number of
    frames in the sheet, the specific frame number, and so on.&nbsp;
    Among the metadata fields on G&amp;N cards is a "type" field; these
    "types" aren't documented, as far as I know, but what I've noticed
    is that they're interpreted as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Type 01:&nbsp; Actual engineering <i>drawings</i>.</li>
      <li>Type 02:&nbsp; These are <i>documents</i>, with titles that
        tend to read "PRODUCT SPECIFICATION, CONFIGURATION AND
        ACCEPTANCE TEST REQUIREMENTS FOR <i>SOME ASSEMBLY NAME</i>".&nbsp;

















































































        In the index tables, I shorten this to just "CONFIG. &amp;
        ACCEPTANCE TEST REQS., <i>SOME ASSEMBLY NAME</i>".&nbsp; This
        can be confusing because they usually (but not always) have
        identical drawing numbers to the Type 01 drawings they're
        associated with.&nbsp; They may provide a lot of supplemental
        information such as expected voltage levels and waveforms that
        the electrical drawings don't provide.</li>
      <li>Type 03:&nbsp; I've only encountered a handful of these, but
        they are documents with titles like "ASSEMBLY TEST PROCEDURE FOR
        <i>SOME ASSEMBLY NAME</i>".</li>
      <li>Type 05:&nbsp; These are also documents, and seem to have to
        do with post-installation checkout procedures for equipment
        (such as the G&amp;N system) installed in the spacecraft.</li>
      <li>Type 10:&nbsp; I've only seen a few of these, but they seem to
        be engineering drawings indistinguishable from Type 01.&nbsp; I
        suspect it's just a misprint for 01.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    It is currently an ongoing effort on my part to scan all of the
    boxes of aperture cards (nominally 1800 cards each) of Apollo
    G&amp;N drawings, and then conceivably the LM drawings from
    Grumman.&nbsp; At present only a miniscule part of this scheme has
    been completed, &nbsp; Where those complete box scans have become
    available, they are the best places to browse drawings, since each
    box tends to contain a range of consecutive drawing numbers.&nbsp;
    Failing that, the <a href="AgcDrawingIndex.html">miscellaneous
      index</a> contains mostly alternate scans of subsets of the cards
    in the complete-box scans, but also contains a few hundred drawings
    missing from the National Archives' boxes.<br>

      you should happen to download an image from the Internet Archive
      site by using your browser's "save image as" function, or if you
      try to download a PDF from there, if you're not careful you will
      probably get a very low-quality (though usually adequate) image
      rather then the full-resolution scan.&nbsp; To avoid or reduce
      this quality reduction in downloading from our Internet Archive
      site, you can do one of the following:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of downloading an <i>individual</i> image of a page,
        you can download the full GENERIC RAW BOOK file.&nbsp; This file
        is precisely what I uploaded to the Internet Archive in the
        first place, and therefore is the maximum quality you're going
        to be able to get.&nbsp; The downside is that since it contains
        all of the pages in that particular batch of scans, it may be a
        very large download.</li>
      <li>Or similarly, you can download the SINGLE PAGE PROCESSED JP2
        file instead.&nbsp; This has similar upsides and downsides as
        the GENERIC RAW BOOK file but is often (though not always!) a
        smaller file.&nbsp; There is a <i>theoretical</i> quality
        reduction from the GENERIC RAW BOOK file, but it's unlikely to
        be anything you could notice even if you try very hard to do so.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Or, you can still use the "save image as" function to save
        just a single image, but before doing so you should "zoom in" a
        few times (perhaps 3 times) rather than just using whatever
        fills your screen.&nbsp; That fools the Internet Archive into
        giving you the full image resolution.&nbsp; What you get will be
        a JPEG file, which is theoretically of lower quality than the
        images GENERIC RAW BOOK file, but you are unlikely to be able to
        notice any difference visually.&nbsp; (For example, many of the
        engineering-drawing images were scanned at a resolution of
        10592×7392 pixels, and I find that if I just do a save-image-as
        without any zooms I get just a 2648×1848 JPEG; if I zoom-in once
        or twice, I get 5296×3696; if I zoom-in three or more times, I
        get the full 10592×7392.&nbsp; Your mileage, of course, may
        vary!)</li>
      <li>Finally, at least if you're using the Google Chrome browser,
        instead of using "save image as" you can right-click on the
        image and use "open image in new tab" instead.&nbsp; In the
        browser's URL bar, if you look at the very end of the URL,
        you'll see "...&amp;scale=<i>SOMENUMBER</i>&amp;rotate=0".&nbsp;

      can be found at our GitHub site</a>, but aren't explicitly linked
    in the index, and <a href="KiCad">renderings of the CAD files as
      images can be found here</a>.&nbsp; The latter will obviously be
    of much higher legibility than the scans of the original drawings,
    but also will potentially differ from them in some ways.

    <h1><a name="Versioning"></a>Versioning the AGC and DSKY<br>
    </h1>
    The AGC and DSKY part-numbering scheme looked like this:<br>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER-DASHNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, Block II AGCs had <i>PARTNUMBER</i>s 2003100,
      2003200, and 2003993, with <i>DASHNUMBER</i>s like -011, -021,
      -031, and so on.&nbsp; <i>REVISION</i>s were letter codes, such
      as A, B, C, etc., or else a dash (-) for "no revision".&nbsp; For
      example,<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>2003200-011A<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Given a part number for a particular AGC (or DSKY) model, the
      part number then relates to a set of sub-assemblies (often
      represented by electrical schematics or mechanical drawings), many
      of which are circuit modules, which themselves may have varying
      versions over time, and have part-numbers like<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, the AGC with p/n 2003200-011A contained, among other
      things, an "oscillator module" which fit into a backplane socket
      labeled B7, and which itself had a p/n 2005003E ... and naturally,
      we have drawing 2005003E if you want to see it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In general, those <i>DASHNUMBER</i>s cover different
      configurations handled within the same engineering drawing.&nbsp;
      For example, drawing 2003100 might cover both configurations -011
      and -021, and you'd have to read the drawing itself to understand
      how unit 2003100-021 differs from unit 2003100-011.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With rare exceptions, different <i>REVISION</i>s of a drawing do
      not introduce any design changes within a specific configuration,
      but may be used to cumulatively add a new configuration.&nbsp; In
      other words, as long as a particular revision of a drawing
      contains the configuration you're interested in, it doesn't really
      matter (usually) that later revisions of a drawing may also exist,
      because later revisions won't differ substantively as far as any
      given configuration is concerned.<br>
    </p>
    <h1><a name="CAD_Files_and_Images"></a>CAD Transcriptions of Apollo
      Engineering Drawings<br>
    </h1>
    <p>In addition to providing scans of original electrical and
      mechanical drawings from the Apollo program, there is an ongoing
      effort to transcribe these drawings into CAD files.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Such CAD transcriptions are made as faithfully visually to the
      original as is feasible, given the capabilities of the CAD program
      involved, as long as there is no compromise of electrical or
      mechanical correctness.&nbsp; But realize that transcription is a
      human effort, so transcribed CAD files may at first contain
      errors; conversely, they may from time to time correct errors
      present in the original drawings — naturally, though, with
      suitable notes indicating that the change had been made, and
      why.&nbsp; It has also been possible occasionally to reconstruct
      some currently-missing drawings from the original Apollo Program.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Electrical_Drawings_"></a>Electrical Drawings<br>
    </h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p>As far as electrical CAD files are concerned, no community effort
      has developed to transcribe the electrical drawings into CAD, but
      it now appears as though one isn't really needed since I'm sure I
      can do them all myself ... eventually.&nbsp; You can simply treat
      the CAD files as resources which appeared from nowhere, but which
      you are free to use or modify for your own purposes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To do so, the open-source <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad
        electrical-design software</a> is used.&nbsp; It is available,
      for free of course, on Windows, Mac OS X, and all of the major
      flavors of Linux.&nbsp; The electrical schematics which have been
      transcribed into CAD, or are in the process of being transcribed,
      are stored in our GitHub repository:<br>

                CAD Drawing Repository</a></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>The CAD drawings are typically rendered as PNG images as well,
      and <a href="KiCad/">provided separately</a> for convenient
      browsing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There's plenty of online material to help you get started with
      KiCad, if you're inclined to do anything more with the CAD files
      as such.&nbsp; Here's the executive summary of what you need to
      know if you want to specifically work with our electrical
      schematics in KiCad:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's best to use the <i>nightly build</i> of KiCad (presently
        v6) rather than a stable version of it (presently v4 or v5), to
        stay as up-to-date as possible with respect to the bug reports
        we file.</li>
      <li>What you find in our GitHub repository for any given
        transcribed drawing is the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A folder called Schematics/<i>DRAWINGNUMBER</i>/ containing
          the files for the drawing.&nbsp; For example, the CAD files
          for drawing 2005912B are in Schematics/2005912B/.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A KiCad project file called module.pro, which you will need
          to open.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>Once the project is open, you can run the schematic editor
          (eeschema) from KiCad's menu.&nbsp; The schematic page that
          opens up will <i>usually</i> look like 2 (or 1 or 3)
          rectangular blocks.&nbsp; Each of the rectangular blocks
          represents one of the original sheets of the drawing.&nbsp;
          Just double-click on one of the blocks to see the schematic
          for that page. <br>
        </li>
        <li>We use a grid size of 25 mils within the schematics.&nbsp;
          You should set the grid size to 25 mils and stay with it.</li>
        <li>Similarly, in the preferences, set the default line width to
          20 mils.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Many of the drawings consist largely of open-collector
          3-input NOR gates and oval-shaped pads, neither marked on the
          schematics with reference designators, so you may need to rely
          on notes within the schematic to know what's what.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>All of the symbol libraries for eeschema used in our CAD
        drawings are <i>custom</i> libraries, and no standard KiCad
        libraries are used.&nbsp; If you find that symbols are missing
        in the schematics you load, you'll have to maneuver through
        KiCad's menu system to individually enable all of the libraries
        needed.&nbsp; These are the *.lib files in the GitHub
        repository.&nbsp; There are a lot of them, primarily because of
        visual and power-supply variations the schematics need for the
        dual NOR-gate part; the main library, exclusive of the NOR
        gates, is AGC_DSKY.lib.</li>
      <li>You may also get warnings when loading a schematic about the
        library versions having changed and asking if you want to
        "recover" any symbols.&nbsp; The answer is that you do <i>not</i>
        want to recover any of them, which at the present time means you
        will need to uncheck the boxes next to every symbol it offers to
        recover for you.</li>
      <li>There's a lot of more-detailed information that may be useful
        in the repository's <a

    <p>Though no help in transcription is really needed, help in
      proof-reading and/or correcting the CAD files vs the original
      drawings is welcomed, and you can contact me directly at the
      address at the bottom of this page if you're interested.&nbsp;
      Just proof-reading doesn't actually require using CAD or even
      having expert electrical knowledge.&nbsp; It just involves
      comparing two images like the ones below and seeing how they
      differ from each other (click to enlarge):<br>

    <p>I would ask that submissions conform to the following:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 2D CAD files should be mechanically accurate with respect
        to the original drawings.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If changes to the original design have been made to correct
        errors in the original drawing (or for any other reason), you
        should add notes to the CAD drawing explaining what has
        happened, and why, when, and who made the change.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The files should be in DXF format.</li>
      <li>The file naming should conform to the original Apollo drawing
        number and revision.&nbsp; In other words, if you have
        transcribed drawing 1234567A, it should be named 1234567A.dxf.<br>

    <br>
    I'd like any submissions to conform to the following requirements:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Models must be provided in the form of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21">STEP files</a>,
        and may optionally be supplemented by a readme file that
        contains any useful information about the model, yourself, the
        change history, etc.&nbsp; At present, no additional file types
        are desired or accepted.</li>
      <li>File-naming convention:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Case 1:&nbsp; If the model is intended to exactly represent
          the original Apollo mechanical drawing, for example 1234567A,
          then it should be named the same way, but with a ".stp"
          extension:&nbsp; 1234567A.stp.&nbsp; Notice that both the
          drawing <i>number</i> and <i>revision</i> are used.&nbsp; In
          this case, the readme file can be omitted, but will be
          accepted if supplied.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Case 2:&nbsp; If the model has been modified in some way —
          perhaps because you believe you have improved it or fixed bugs
          in it, or have modified it to be manufactured with different
          materials — you should add some extra description within the
          filename itself:&nbsp; 1234567A-<i>ExtraDescriptionOfChanges</i>.stp.&nbsp;
(I'd




































































































































          also personally prefer that filenames don't contain spaces,
          though hyphens and underlines are okay.)&nbsp; In this case,
          you should definitely provide the extra readme file to cover
          the changes in detail.</li>
        <li>The optional readme file should be named identically to the
          STEP file, but with the ".md" extension instead:&nbsp;
          1234567A.md or 1234567A-<i>ExtraDescriptionOfChanges</i>.md.&nbsp;



































































          The ".md" indicates that the file is in <a
            href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">"markdown"



































































            format</a>, which means that it could still be a pure-text
          file if you like, but can additionally include enhanced
          formatting.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>The STEP files should be importable by <a
          href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD open-source design
          software</a>, though they can be created in any modeling
        software you favor.&nbsp; Nevertheless, only STEP files are
        accepted into the repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="Submissions"></a>Submissions</h3>
    <p>The best procedure for making your submissions to the repository
      is this:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an account for <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
        if you don't already have one.</li>

          this explanation of how to do so</a>.&nbsp; Basically, you

    <p>The trays contain connectors allowing A to be connected to B, or
      vice-versa, and to the outside world.&nbsp; Each tray also
      contains a "backplane" into which electronics modules can be
      plugged.&nbsp; The A-tray modules have designations like A1, A2,
      ..., A31, while the B-tray modules have designations like B1, B2,
      ..., B17.<br>

    <p>Each of these modules has an associated drawing.&nbsp; For
      example, in the 2003200-011 AGC, module A1 (the "scaler" module)
      has electrical drawing 2005259A.&nbsp; In other words, each module
      is considered to comprise a single circuit, with a unique (though
      possibly multi-sheet) drawing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Modules A1 - A24 consist entirely of "logic": i.e., their
      electrical drawings consist entirely of NOR-gates and the
      connectors for plugging the modules into the
      backplane.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, I suppose, the
      drawings aren't called "schematics", but are often given the
      special name "LOGIC FLOW DIAGRAMS".&nbsp; But they're schematics
      anyway.&nbsp; Modules A25 - A31 and B1 - B17 are entirely analog
      in nature and are specifically called "SCHEMATICS".<br>
    </p>
    <p>As far as the construction of the circuitry is concerned, three
      basic techniques were intermixed:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logic-flow module (A1 - A24) construction changed over time:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Early 2003100 AGCs: The components of a module were
          partitioned into 4 "quadrants", and the components of each
          quadrant were mounted on a multilayer nickel ribbon.&nbsp; The
          4 ribbons themselves were also interconnected at various
          strategic spots.&nbsp; This design proved not to work properly
          because of excessive interconnection delays due to the
          properties of the ribbon, though as far as I know, the design
          was basically sound in other respects and should still work if
          a better interconnection technique is used.&nbsp; The picture
          below is of a logic module with just such a nickel ribbon<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Module with nickel-ribbon logic"

    </div>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>2003993, 2003200, and later 2003100 AGCs: Each module
          contains two multilayer circuit boards, though I've chosen to
          show you only one of them in the image below.&nbsp; We'd see
          the other one if we flipped the module over.<br>
        </li>

    </div>
    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Analog modules (A25 - A29, B1 - B17):&nbsp; These used
        so-called "welded cordwood" construction.&nbsp; What that means
        is that you have a metal block with holes in it, like Swiss
        cheese; the components (such as resistors, capacitors,
        transistors, etc.) are inserted into the holes in the block,
        with their leads protruding from either side.&nbsp; Wires are
        then welded (not soldered) to the leads to interconnect the
        components.&nbsp; In the image below, note the nifty insert
        providing reference designators for the components.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div align="center"><img src="SF9-B8-flip-zoom.jpg" alt=""

    </ul>
    <p>Of course, these details don't matter much in modern terms unless
      you're <i>very</i> enthusiastic about building an AGC re-creation
      and want to do it absolutely 100% authentically.&nbsp; If you
      were, you would be defeated in the end by the fact that the
      electronic components originally used, such as the dual
      triple-input NOR gates, are no longer available in precisely the
      form they were originally used.&nbsp; And while I haven't priced
      core memory lately, I expect that it's probably not terribly
      cost-effective.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16"
        height="16">&nbsp; Though, surprisingly, you can get junked
      core-memory systems from eBay; not from the AGC, naturally, but
      perhaps close enough that they could be made to work if mined for
      parts.<br>

      II AGC p/n 2003100-021</h1>
    <p>This is an interesting version of the AGC, in that the logic
      circuitry was constructed in a very different fashion than later
      dash numbers of 2003100 (and the later versions 2003200 and
      2003993) were.&nbsp; Those later versions used multi-layer printed
      circuit boards to hold the integrated circuits, whereas <i>this</i>
      version interconnected them via a nickel ribbon.&nbsp; <a
        href="Documents/HSI-25007.pdf">The nickel-ribbon design turned
        out to have too much capacitance, resulting in excessive signal
        delay, and the design didn't function in practice</a>.&nbsp;
      This is what resulted in the introduction of multi-layer printed
      circuit boards instead.&nbsp; That's not to say, of course, that
      there's anything wrong with the electrical schematics for this
      design, since the physical construction of the circuitry is
      basically outside the scope of the electrical schematics.&nbsp;
      I'm told that all existing functional 2003100 AGC units are of the
      multi-layer printed-circuit variety.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the nickel-ribbon interconnect, the circuitry for
      the various modules was actually divided into four separate
      "quadrants" of circuitry, which were mostly rather independent but
      did have some interaction with each other.&nbsp; Later designs
      removed the concept of quadrants altogether.<br>

        document ND-1021043 of March 10, 1966</a>, supposedly relates to
      AGC p/n 2003100-021 (according to its Tables 3-I and 7-I), and its
      Table 8-II lists all of the associated module drawings.&nbsp; But
      I don't believe there are any differences between the circuitry it
      presents and that presented by ND-1021042.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, there's the question of "signal wiring diagrams".&nbsp;
      These are related to the nickel-ribbon interconnect described
      above. To understand what that is and how to read one, consult the
      <a href="#Appendix:_Signal_Wiring_Diagrams">Appendix</a>.&nbsp; It
      should be noted that because of the later reworking of the design
      to replace the nickel-ribbon interconnect with a multi-layer
      printed circuit board, the reference designators and pin numbering
      from later versions is not closely related to numbering of this
      version of the design.<br>

    <h1><a name="PartNumbers"></a>Appendix: Evolution of Block II AGC
      Part Numbers</h1>
    The way different part numbers of AGCs (or DSKYs) are related to one
    another is that you start with a given assembly with a certain part
    number (such as Block II AGC with p/n 2003100-011), then you apply
    an Engineering Change Proposal, or ECP for short, such as ECP 322
    (described as "computer wiring changes"), with the result that you
    now have a different assembly p/n 2003100-021.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The list below shows how all known Block II AGC part numbers are
    interrelated according to the principle just mentioned.&nbsp; Many
    of these changes clearly are not electrical in nature, or else refer
    to intermediate or test versions of the AGC.&nbsp; Sometimes there
    are multiple paths to get to the same part number, if the ECPs are
    applied in different orders.&nbsp; For example, p/n 2003993-061 +
    ECP 815 = p/n 2003993-071 + ECP 719 = p/n 2003993-111.&nbsp; I've
    only bothered to show one such path below in the few cases where
    that happens.<br>

    We don't have an official document, in so far as I am aware, giving
    the Instrumentation Lab's part numbers for electronics components
    like resistors, capacitors, transistors, and so on.&nbsp; Many of
    them are deducible from other documents, like the AGC Handbook
    drawings.&nbsp; For example, from drawing 2005952-, we can find out
    that part number 1006750-32 is a 1/4W 1K resistor with a 2%
    tolerance, while part number 1010406-7 is an 8.2 μH 10% tolerance
    R.F. coil.&nbsp; Mike Stewart (thanks, Mike!) has done a lot of that
    for us, but the task is still incomplete.<br>

    modern terms you can think of the SCD as being like the data sheets

      Wiring Diagrams for the Block II and the NOR-Gate Problem<br>
    </h1>
    <p><img alt="" src="typicalCircuitry.png" width="309" height="252"
        align="right">This section describes an issue that affects only
      so-called "logic flow diagrams" (rather than analog-circuitry
      schematics), and only early Block II AGC models and CDUs.<br>
    </p>
    <p>First, an elementary introductory digression, for anyone who
      isn't an electronics expert but has persevered in reading to this
      point.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When designing electronic circuitry, it is customary to assign
      each electrical component in the circuit a unique "reference
      designator" (or "refd", pronounced REF-DEE, for short), and to
      refer to the components by those refd's.&nbsp; The refd's can be
      anything, but customarily they consist of a letter to indicate the
      general type of component — R for resistors, C for capacitors, D
      (or perhaps CR) for diodes, and so on — followed by a number to
      indicate which specific component it is within the circuit.&nbsp;
      For example, in the typical kind of circuit diagram shown to the
      right, you see resistors R1 through R7, capacitor C3, transistors
      Q1 through Q3, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Integrated circuits (IC's) typically have U as the alphabetical
      prefix, thus you might have integrated circuits U1, U2, U3, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>One thing that happens sometimes is that a given component might
      actually be a conveniently packaged-together collection of <i>several</i>
      essentially interchangeable simpler parts.&nbsp; For example, a
      "dual NOR gate" integrated circuit would be a device that provides
      two separate NOR gates, which are independent of each other but
      are packaged together to save space or cost or for some other
      reason of convenience.&nbsp; When that happens, the overall
      integrated circuit still has a U-based refd, perhaps U3, but the
      two NOR-gates comprising it each have refd's of their own, which
      would normally be U3A and U3B.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="SenseAmplifierCircuit.jpg" alt="" width="541"
        height="393" align="right">The example of a NOR-gate wasn't
      chosen arbitrarily. In fact, since integrated circuits were a
      pretty new development during the early Apollo Program, and were
      still suspiciously unreliable and quite expensive, the AGC
      circuitry originally didn't use any of them.&nbsp; Eventually,
      though, the relentless pressure to miniaturize forced integrated
      circuits into the design.&nbsp; As it happens, the AGC ended up
      using a single type of integrated circuit (the DSKY used none at
      all), though it used <i>lots</i> of them.&nbsp; As you've
      probably guessed, that one type of IC was in fact a dual
      triple-input NOR gate.<br>
    </p>
    <p>(Actually, that's a bit of an over-simplification, though it's
      largely true for our purposes.&nbsp; In fact, the Block II AGC
      used dual NOR gate integrated circuits, as stated, but the Block I
      AGC used integrated circuits containing a single NOR-gate
      each.&nbsp; Besides that, the sense amplifier modules used
      comparatively small numbers of sense-amplifier integrated
      circuits, whose internal composition is depicted in the figure to
      the right.&nbsp; The sense amplifier integrated circuit was
      exactly as complex as a dual triple-input NOR gate integrated IC,
      in that each of them contained 6 NPN transistors and 8 resistors
      ... which is just an interesting factoid and is neither here nor
      there.&nbsp; For the purposes of our present discussion, neither
      the Block I NOR gates nor the sense-amplifier ICs are of any
      relevance whatever.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>I won't bore you by telling you about the general properties of
      NOR gates, but to understand the discussion in this section you do
      need to know a couple of different things about them.&nbsp;
      Firstly, in the AGC schematics a NOR gate is symbolized either as<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="NORgates.png" width="244"
        height="43"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div align="left">and secondly, all of the three inputs of a NOR
      gate are interchangeable, in the sense that if you swapped any two
      of them, the behavior of the device would remain the same. (I
      suppose it may also be worth noting that of the two NOR-gate
      representations above, you can have two of the left-hand kind as
      the A and B parts of a dual NOR gate, or two of the right-hand
      kind, but not one of each.)<br>
      <br>
      What this is all leading up to is that some of the CDU and early
      AGC (p/n 2003100 only) electrical schematic drawings:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Do not list any ref's for NOR-gates, so we have no way of
          knowing from the schematics which individual NOR gate is
          packaged with any other into a dual-NOR IC; and</li>
        <li>Do not list any pin numbers for the NOR-gate inputs, so we
          have know way of knowing which of the interchangeable inputs
          any given input signal is hooked up to.</li>
      </ol>
      <div align="left"><img alt="" src="numberedSchematic.png"
          width="474" height="247" align="right"></div>
      <p>To get a sense of this, to the right there are two versions of
        a sample (nonsense) circuit consisting of NOR gates, one with
        refd's and pin numbers, and one without.&nbsp; In the right-hand
        version, we know, for example, that pin U1A-J is connected to
        pins U1B-F, U2A-F, and U2B-F.&nbsp; In the left-hand version we
        know that the output from one NOR gate is connected to some
        input or other on each of the other NOR gates.&nbsp; Imagine
        trying to repair or discuss the left-hand version!<br>
      </p>
      <p>As far as the operation of the circuit is concerned, of course,
        it makes no difference at all whether or not those refd's or pin
        numbers are there, because all of the NOR gates are
        interchangeable and all of the inputs to them are
        interchangeable, so the OUTPUT we get from any given INPUT is
        still exactly the same.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the same way, you personally may not care one way or the
        other which specific NOR gate is used for any given purpose in
        the AGC circuitry, nor may you care which input pin is which on
        those NOR gates.&nbsp; If that's so, you don't need to read any
        further ... just go back to looking at the schematics presented
        above on this page and enjoy!<br>
      </p>
      <p>But the truth is that the original AGC developers did care
        which NOR gate was which and what pin number was what ... it's
        just that for some reason they didn't find it convenient to put
        that information directly into some of the schematic diagrams
        for AGC p/n 2003100, and hence they chose to provide it through
        some other mechanism.&nbsp; That mechanism is the so-called
        "signal wiring diagram", and each of the schematic drawings in
        the AGC 2003100 containing NOR gates had an associated signal
        wiring diagram.&nbsp; Below, there's a "typical" (actually,
        slightly more legible than usual) portion of a signal wiring
        diagram:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="typicalSignalWiringDiagram.jpg" width="1328" height="645"></div>
      <p>You may be forgiven for thinking that this makes the situation
        even more confusing to deal with, particularly since you are
        quite correct about it, but it helps if you know how to read
        it!&nbsp; When you know how to read it, it tells you which
        NOR-gates are paired into which in the dual NOR-gate IC's, which
        of the pair is the "A" member of the duet and which is the "B"
        member, and which pin numbers the signals are hooked up to.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It doesn't tell you exactly how to specify the refd's of the
        dual-NOR IC's, but we know from other versions of the AGC
        roughly how they did that, so we'll talk about that later.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first thing to notice is that one side of the diagram is
        marked as LEFT and the other as RIGHT.&nbsp; In this drawing,
        LEFT is at the bottom and RIGHT is at the top, but in other
        drawings that's reversed, so try to think only of LEFT and RIGHT
        instead of bottom and top.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Next, notice the little numbers written along the LEFT or
        bottom edge (39155, 39145, 39149, ...) and RIGHT or top edge
        (39156, 19151, 39152, ...).&nbsp; Those numbers are actually
        written on the NOR gates in the schematics, in lieu of refd's,
        and each individual NOR gate is identified uniquely by these
        numbers.&nbsp; These are called "gate numbers".&nbsp; So, a pair
        of such gate numbers could uniquely specify a dual-NOR
        gate.&nbsp; The RIGHT numbers are the "A" NOR gates, and the
        numbers opposite them on the LEFT are the associated "B" NOR
        gates within the same dual NOR IC.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Before talking about the other stuff written on the diagram,
        let's talk a little more about the dual-NOR ICs.&nbsp; The AGC's
        were 10-pin rectangular packages, with the pins on them
        variously labeled either numerically or alphabetically,
        depending on the purpose of the discussion.&nbsp; We might draw
        it like so, with the "A" NOR gate on the left and the "B" NOR
        gate on the right:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dualNOR.png" width="311"
          height="299"></div>
      <p><br>
        Ignore the fact that the NOR gates now look like little rocket
        ships; that may or may not be significant.&nbsp; Rather, the
        important things to note are that there are VCC and GND inputs
        to power the device, that the "A" gate has pins 1-4 (or J, A, B,
        C), and that the "B" gate has pins 6-9 (or D, E, F, K).<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you look along the bottom (LEFT) edge of the signal wiring
        diagram, you'll see a repeating pattern (from left to right)
        consisting of<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>a small square</li>
        <li>an even smaller circle</li>
        <li>empty position<br>
        </li>
        <li>empty position</li>
        <li>empty position<br>
        </li>
        <li>an oval with a number inside </li>
      </ol>
      <div align="left">
        <div align="left">Similarly, along the top (RIGHT) edge of the
          signal wiring diagram, you'll see a similar but slightly less
          regular pattern of 6 positions:<br>
        </div>
        <div align="left">
          <ol>
            <li>small circle</li>

            <li>position with several possible markings</li>

                    find that what we're calling position 6 here
                    actually appears at position 1 and the other
                    positions are simply displaced downward by 1.&nbsp;
                    That won't affect our discussion at all, and in fact
                    you might not even notice it if it hadn't been
                    pointed out to you, so we'll just ignore that
                    nicety.&nbsp; We'll get to what those non-NOR things
                    are later, but the point to understand right now is
                    that 9 of each dual-NOR's 10 pins appear in a
                    regular manner along these edges, and are easily
                    associated with their gate numbers.&nbsp; (Pin 5,
                    GND, isn't explicitly shown on the diagram, and we
                    won't worry ourselves about it.)<br>
                  </div>
                  <div align="left"> <br>
                    What about those weird, snake-like horizontal lines
                    running lengthwise along the middle of the signal
                    wiring diagram?&nbsp; Wires!&nbsp; Where the wire
                    points downward, there's a connection along the
                    bottom edge of the diagram, whereas when it points
                    upward there's a connection along the top edge of
                    the diagram.&nbsp; In the image below, I've added
                    some false coloring to just one of those snakelike
                    lines to focus the attention on it:<br>
                    <br>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="coloredSignalWiringDiagram.jpg" width="1328" height="645"></div>
      <p>So according to the description I just gave, the wire makes a
        connection to the following:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOR-gate at location 39155, pin 9 (output of a "B" NOR gate)</li>
        <li>NOR-gate at location 39107, pin 9 (output of a different "B"
          NOR gate)</li>
        <li>An oval with a <i>very</i> smudgy 111 written in it.&nbsp;
          Maybe.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, if you know anything about electronics, you may be worried
        that the outputs of two different NOR gates are tied
        together.&nbsp; Don't worry, though, these NOR-gates have
        open-collector outputs (or more precisely, open-collector with a
        pullup resistor to VCC), and so they can be tied together to
        increase their drive capacity (or to effectively increase the
        number of NOR inputs for a single output) without any problem.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps I should finally say what some of these non-NOR
        markings along the edges are:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A numbered oval is a pin on the connector from the circuit
          to the AGC's backplane.&nbsp; In other words, a signal leaving
          or entering the circuit.</li>
        <li>A pointed box like &lt;VCC&gt; or &lt;0V&gt; is a
          power-supply or ground connection.</li>
        <li>A rectangular box with an alphanumeric label inside of it is
          an "inter-quadrant" connection, and we'll get to that in a
          moment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At any rate, the point is that this red wire represents two
        NOR-gates tied together to drive connector pin 111.&nbsp; Now, I
        didn't mention it before, but this signal wiring diagram happens
        to be from <a href="AGCHandbook/A5-2005061D-1.jpg">sheet 1 of
          drawing 2005061D</a>, and if we look at that drawing, we will
        indeed find that connector pin 111 is being driven by NOR gates
        39107 and 39155.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What is this "inter-quadrant" thing of which I spoke, and for
        that matter, what is a "quadrant" anyway?<br>
      </p>
      <p>For these AGC modules, the connector from the module to the AGC
        backplane has 4 rows of 69 pins each (numbered 1 to 71, but with
        21 and 51 missing).&nbsp; Each one of those rows of pins
        essentially has its own circuit associated with it, and these
        separate circuits are called "quadrants".&nbsp; The concept of
        the "quadrant" was used only for early dash numbers of the
        2003100 AGC (such as the one we have schematics for!), and
        disappeared for later 2003100 versions, and for the 2003200 and
        2003993 AGC's, though much of the numbering of components on the
        schematics remains tied to the quadrant concept even if the
        quadrants themselves disappeared.<br>
      </p>
      <p>By "separate circuits", I mean logically separate rather than
        physically separated onto different circuit boards, though
        apparently that was originally what was tried.&nbsp; And
        usually, the circuitry on the quadrants isn't <i>entirely</i>
        logically independent of the circuitry on the other quadrants,
        and in that case there have to be one or more electrical
        connections between the quadrants of the module ... i.e.,
        inter-quadrant connections.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In fact, the signal wiring diagram I've been showing you isn't
        the complete diagram for drawing 2005061D, but simply the signal
        wiring diagram for quadrant 1 of 2005061D.&nbsp; There are three
        other quadrants, and therefore 3 other signal wiring diagrams
        for this module as well.&nbsp; Most modules have a complete
        complement of 4 quadrants, and thus have 4 signal wiring
        diagrams associated with them.&nbsp; But some modules have less
        quadrants and therefore less signal wiring diagrams.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So now all of the questions are answered except for
        refd's.&nbsp; For that, I want to direct your attention just
        above the row of gate numbers at the bottom edge of the signal
        wiring diagram shown above, or just below the row of gate
        numbers along the top edge.&nbsp; You'll see a row of tiny, tiny
        numbers going from 1 (at the left) to 180 (at the right)
        there.&nbsp; Or more accurately, you'll see rows of tiny smudges
        that may or may not be numbers, but you can still see that there
        are 180 of them.&nbsp; Let's call these things "smudge numbers",
        for lack of a better term.&nbsp; The IC's are numbered
        sequentially, starting at the end with the larger smudge
        numbers, where we find U01, and moving toward the end with the
        smaller smudge numbers, where we find U30.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Actually, there's some subtlety involve here.&nbsp; For
        example, what happens if there's an open space, as there is in
        our pictured signal wiring diagram at U23?&nbsp; Should we just
        skip U23 in our numbering altogether, or should the next
        position become U23 rather than U24?&nbsp; You could argue it
        either way, but I'd vote for skipping U23 altogether, because it
        helps preserve IC numbering across different hardware
        versions.&nbsp; In other words, if a dual-NOR is removed or
        added, it won't necessarily cause all of the refd's for the <i>other</i>
        dual-NORs to change.&nbsp; But truthfully, we don't actually
        know what the original designers did in this regard.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another subtlety in the IC numbering is the quadrants:&nbsp;
        The entire circuit module consists of 4 quadrants, and if we
        followed the scheme just described, there would be 4 IC's
        labeled U01, 4 labeled U02, and so on.&nbsp; Not good!&nbsp; So
        in our CAD work we actually prefix the quadrant numbers to the
        IC numbering.&nbsp; In other words, in quadrant 1, the IC's run
        from U101 up to U130; in quadrant 2, the IC's run from U201 up
        to U230; etc.&nbsp; Thus every IC ends up with a unique number
        within the module, and we can still use that number to precisely
        identify where it is located physically.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And finally, one last subtlety:&nbsp; Some of the quadrants
        have signal wiring diagrams as shown, with LEFT on the bottom,
        RIGHT on the top, and smudge numbers increasing from left to
        right.&nbsp; Other quadrants are reversed, with RIGHT on the
        bottom, LEFT on the top, and smudge numbers increasing from
        right to left.&nbsp; My descriptions above are all still
        correct, as long as you keep thinking of LEFT and RIGHT and
        ordering of smudge numbers as I've urged, rather than thinking
        of the top, bottom, right, and left edges of the signal wiring
        diagram as you might otherwise be inclined to do.&nbsp; The
        reason for this reversal seems to have to do with some of the
        quadrants being on the <i>front</i> side, and some being on the
        <i>back</i> side, with the numbering consequently mirror imaged.<br>

        Wiring Diagrams and the Block I AGC</h1>
      <p><img src="NOR-TO-47.jpg" alt="" width="147" height="132"
          align="left"><img src="NOR-TO-47-diag.jpg" alt="" width="464"
          height="491" align="right">For the Block I AGC, problems
        similar to those described in the preceding section exist,
        though the problems and solutions are different in detail.&nbsp;
        In fact, read the preceding section before reading this one so
        that you can have some background for the discussion in this
        section!<br>
      </p>
      <p>One problem that can thankfully be ignored in the Block I AGC
        is that the NOR-gate integrated circuit contains a single
        triple-input NOR gate, packaged in a TO-47 can, rather than two
        independent NOR gates packaged together in a flatpack, as in the
        Block II AGC.&nbsp; That simplifies a lot.&nbsp; You can see
        both a photo of such a gate (to the left) and a diagram
        elucidating its pinout and internal circuit (to the right).<br>
      </p>
      <p>A problem the Block I "logic flow diagrams" (schematics
        containing NOR gates) have that the Block II doesn't have, is
        that there were apparently multiple hardware generations of the
        Block I AGC that were mechanically quite different.&nbsp; In
        particular, both the backplane-connector pin numbers and the
        means for identifying the NOR-gate components differed from one
        hardware generation to the next.&nbsp; The schematic diagrams,
        meanwhile, showed the connector pin numbers and gate
        identification for multiple hardware generations, thus making
        them a tad more confusing than they might have been otherwise.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We don't actually know much about these different hardware
        generations, but here's our current thinking on the
        subject.&nbsp; We think there were three separate Block I AGC
        hardware generations, which <i>may</i> have differed as
        follows:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "AGC 4" generation:&nbsp; Might have been a rack-mount
          computer.&nbsp; I.e., not of a similar size or shape to flight
          models.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The "AGC 4B" generation:&nbsp; Might have been the first
          with integrated circuits, as opposed to NOR gates constructed
          from discrete transistors and resistors as in the diagram to
          the right (which represents the internal structure of the NOR
          integrated circuit).&nbsp; Using integrated circuits would
          have miniaturized the circuit.&nbsp; The substitution doesn't
          affect functionality, so we'd expect software written for the
          one generation to execute properly on the other generation.</li>
        <li>The "AGC 5" generation:&nbsp; Might have been constructed
          more-or-less the same was as the flight computers were.&nbsp;
          I.e., in a similar form factor.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="excerpt-1006545-.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="219"
        align="left">For example, in the tiny excerpt from one of the
      Block I electrical schematics to the left, consider the NOR gate
      with the markings "2G5" and "65129".&nbsp; "2G5" was how the gate
      was identified in generation "AGC 4", while "65129" was how it was
      identified in generation "AGC 5", according to the notes (not
      shown) written in the schematic itself.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Similarly, consider the connector pin for the
        backplane signal "MPO".&nbsp; It is marked both as pin #94 and
        as pin #104. The former is for AGC 4, while the latter is for
        AGC 5.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      However, the Block I AGC schematics have the same characteristics
      as the early Block II schematics, in the sense that they do not
      display pin numbers for the (interchangeable) <i> inputs</i> of
      the NOR gates, nor do they indicate what we would think of as
      reference designators for the NOR gates.&nbsp; Of course, since
      there's was a single NOR gate per integrated circuit, the
      gate-number markings (like "2G5" or "65129) could basically serve
      double-duty as reference designators, and having a separate
      reference designator doesn't really serve much purpose, so perhaps
      there weren't any at all.&nbsp; Plus, each of the NOR gates in the
      example to the left has a single input ... but from the figure
      above, we know that pins 1, 3, and 5 of the NOR gate were all
      interchangeable, so which input is the one being used?&nbsp; They
      probably are <i>not</i> all the "middle" pin, pin #3, since that
      wouldn't always have been the pin it was most convenient to
      physically route a wire to.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      At any rate, since the schematic doesn't have this kind of info in
      it, the information has to come from somewhere else.&nbsp; It must
      instead be deduced instead from the so-called "wiring
      diagrams".&nbsp; These Block I wiring diagrams, however, though
      quite similar in concept were quite different in detail from the
      Block II signal wiring diagrams described in the preceding
      section.&nbsp; The image below is a wiring diagram for the Block I
      "scaler" module, otherwise known as AGC modules A33 and A34.&nbsp;
      (Identical modules were plugged into slots A33 and A34.)&nbsp; The
      wiring diagram itself is drawing 1006127A, while the corresponding
      electrical schematic drawing is 1006547G.&nbsp; The original
      drawing was in black&amp;white (at least, by the time <i>we</i>
      got it), but I've added various color notations to it for the
      purpose of this discussion.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><a
          href="BlockIWiringDiagram-1006127A-annotated.jpg"><img
            src="BlockIWiringDiagram-1006127A-annotated-small.jpg"

        <i>(Click to enlarge)</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Perhaps the first thing to note is that there are two separate
      circuits in this wiring diagram.&nbsp; There's the "even" half,
      depicted on the left-hand side of this diagram, consisting of the
      columns labeled<br>
      <div align="center">&nbsp;<img src="wd1-6.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36"> &nbsp; <img src="wd1-2.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36">&nbsp; <img src="wd1-4.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36"><br>
      </div>
      and the "odd" half (the right-hand side of the diagram), with
      columns labeled<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-5.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="wd1-3.png" alt=""
          width="37" height="36">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="wd1-7.png"
          alt="" width="37" height="36"><br>
      </div>
      Of those, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are intended to represent the
      front sides of the circuits, while <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>,
      and <b>7</b> (being mirror imaged) represent the back side of the
      circuits.<br>
      <br>
      These two halves are independent of each other, in the sense that
      the only electrical connections between the two are via the
      backplane.&nbsp; In other words, if you wanted to connect a signal
      in the left half of the circuit to one in the right half, the
      signal would have to go out through the module's connector, onto
      the AGC backplane, then back up into a different pin on the
      module's backplane connector.&nbsp; There is a 142-pin connector
      (two rows of 71 pins each) to the backplane, with the the even
      half of the circuit using the even-numbered pins and the odd half
      using the odd-numbered pins, and in the diagram the connector pins
      are also depicted as circled numbers like<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-connectorpins.jpg" alt=""
          width="39" height="131"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Each the two halves has 60 NOR gates, labeled in the diagram both
      by a "CIRCUIT NUMBER" and a "POSITION NUMBER", and are depicted in
      the diagram as objects like<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-normal.png" alt="" width="43"
          height="42">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp; <img
          src="wd1-expander.png" alt="" width="43" height="42"><br>
      </div>
      <p>The former are the normal NOR gates, while the latter are the
        so-called "expander" or "fan-in" NOR gates, represented in the
        electrical schematics by the following two symbols,
        respectively:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img alt="" src="NORgates.png" width="244"
          height="43"></p>
      <p>As you can see, each of these NOR gates has 4 signals, as it is
        supposed to, with the open circle being the output and the solid
        circles being the three inputs.&nbsp; As as far as <i>which</i>
        of the filled-in black circles represent <i>which</i> inputs to
        the NOR gates, we don't actually have enough information about
        how the wiring diagrams are interpreted to be able to
        tell.&nbsp; On the basis of the fact that these circular objects
        visually represent the bottom side of the NOR-gate TO-47 cans
        (see the figure at the top right of this section), my
        interpretation would be:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-pinout.jpg" alt="" width="110"
          height="120"></div>
      <p>Of course, a mirror image of this arrangement, or indeed any
        other permutation of pins 1, 2, and 3 would logically be equally
        possible.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Note too that some or all of the NOR-gate pins have solid black
        lines going to them, and of course these represent the
        wires.&nbsp; All of the fat, solid, black lines in the wiring
        diagram are wires.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The final factoid needed to interpret the diagram is to note
        that each of the circuit halves seems to have wires that exit to
        the left or to the right, and then just stop in mid-air, so to
        speak, without actually connecting to anything. Notice, however,
        that the wires exiting to the left and the right are exactly
        paired with each other: for each wire exiting to the left,
        there's one at the exact same position vertically exiting to the
        right.&nbsp; This is intended to mean that those two dangling
        wires are connected together as the same signal.&nbsp; I've
        added a couple of blue lines to the diagram to make this point
        graphically.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Actually, to avoid being misleading, I should admit that it's a
        little trickier than this sometimes.&nbsp; The true is that
        there's not <i>necessarily</i> a unique match between the
        dangling wires exiting to the left and those to the right, so
        sometimes you have to work it out using the schematic as a
        reference.&nbsp; The figure below is an excerpt from a different
        signal-wiring diagram that shows this ambiguity.&nbsp; I can't
        really give you any advice on resolving such ambiguities, other
        than to say that if you trace through the wires, you'll
        (hopefully always) find that one of the possible connections
        makes no sense with respect to the associated schematic, and
        that the other one does.<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="BlockIWiringDiagram-1006127A-ambiguous.jpg" width="786"
          height="71"></div>
      <p>Ignoring complications like that, which are fortunately in the
        minority, let's work out an example in detail.&nbsp; Consider
        the NOR-gate with CIRCUIT NUMBER "--039" at POSITION NUMBER "02"
        at the upper left of the wiring diagram.&nbsp; (You'll have to
        click on the wiring diagram image shown earlier to expand it, in
        order to understand the description below.)&nbsp; In the wiring
        diagram, we see that:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The output of --039, pin 7, exits to the left, where it
          wraps around and connects to a corresponding wire dangling at
          the right, and eventually ends up at connector pin 02.</li>
        <li> Input pin 1 of --039 comes from a signal that comes from or
          goes to the following places:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Output pin 7 of NOR gate --035.</li>
          <li>Input pin 1 of NOR gate --037.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>So ... how well does this correspond to what the corresponding
        electrical schematic drawing, <a
          href="https://archive.org/stream/BlockISchematics#page/n143/mode/1up">1006547G</a>,
        says is supposed to be happening?&nbsp; Well, wonder no
        more!&nbsp; Here's the relevant excerpt from the schematic, and
        as you can see, it is exactly as our interpretation of the
        wiring diagram says it ought to be:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-example.jpg" alt="" width="1061"
          height="195"><br>
        <div align="left"><br>
          But finally, a word of caution:&nbsp; The match between
          electrical schematics and their associated signal wiring
          diagrams is not always as perfect as the explanation above
          implies.&nbsp; Of course, the Apollo Program preceded the
          availability of computerized CAD systems which could have
          automatically generated error-free signal wiring diagrams (if
          they were even needed at all!) directly from the
          schematics.&nbsp; In other words, both the schematics and the
          wiring diagrams had to be separately, manually drawn ...
          naturally, we'd expect occasional errors just on that
          account.&nbsp; But it's somewhat worse than that.&nbsp;
          Consider the example we've been using, namely schematic
          1006547 and associated wiring diagram 1006127.&nbsp; This
          block of circuitry has NOR-gates labeled "--000" through
          "--079", plus additional NOR gates in the range "--301" and
          above.&nbsp; The schematic and wiring diagram match perfectly
          for the range 000-079, but <i>completely differ </i>for the
          range 301+, as if completely different circuits were being
          described by the schematic and the wiring diagram.&nbsp; And
          that may indeed be what happened, since the wiring diagram was
          drawn in February 1963, some three months prior to the
          schematic in May 1963. Possibly there had been second thoughts
          about the partitioning of the circuitry into modules in the
          interim. Thus where the schematics and wiring diagrams match,
          we should feel confident in using the information we find in
          the wiring diagrams to supplement what we find in the
          schematics, but we need to be aware that they <i>may not</i>
          match, and that we must be prepared to work from whichever one
          of those two is "correct".<br>
          <br>
          All very well and good!&nbsp; But how do we know which, if
          either, <i>is</i> correct?&nbsp; I suppose I'd generally vote
          for the schematic, if only because the wiring diagram is a
          much less satisfactory way of visualizing how the circuit
          works.&nbsp; This is particular example of drawings 1006547
          and 1006127, though, there are lots of circumstantial factors
          that would make us choose the schematic over the wiring
          diagram:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The schematic was drawn 3 months later than the wiring
              diagram, and is therefore more current.</li>
            <li>We have 2 revisions of the wiring diagram vs 8 of the
              schematic, so gross errors seem less likely to have
              survived in the schematic than in the wiring diagram.</li>
            <li>The documentation in AC Electronics ND-1021041 matches
              the schematic rather than the wiring diagram.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Introduction<br>
          </h2>
          <p>Along with the various scanned engineering drawings, CAD
            transcriptions, drawing indexes, assembly drilldowns, and
            engineering-drawing search engine we provide, there's also a
            certain amount of software available to help create and
            maintain all of that data.&nbsp; Most of it is undoubtedly
            of little use to anybody not intimately involved in such
            maintenance.&nbsp; But there are a few programs, such as <a
              href="#Navigate_the_Assembly_Hierarchy_">the drilldown.py
              and drilldownCompare.py programs already described above</a>,
            that can be of slightly wider (though still very
            specialized) utility.&nbsp; <br>
          </p>
          <p>On that chance, this Appendix provides a very-brief rundown
            of some of that additional software.&nbsp; Except where
            otherwise stated, such software is generally found in the
            software repository's "schematics" branch, in <a

                    far as how to specify the characteristics of a
                    particular connector configuration, see the comments
                    in the code itself</a>.&nbsp; What the program
                  actually creates is a KiCad .lib file that contains
                  the definition of the connector.&nbsp; In current
                  practice I treat that .lib file as being temporary,
                  because I then use KiCad's symbol-library editor to
                  "import" that symbol from that .lib file into the
                  "AGC_DSKY" symbol library, and then delete the .lib
                  file itself.&nbsp; <a

                  Most variations relate to the (hardcoded) power-supply
                  and return signal names, though there are additional
                  configurable items such as expander vs non-expander,
                  display of pin numbers vs no display of pin numbers,
                  numerical pin numbers vs alphabetical pin numbers, and
                  Block II vs Block I vs ND-1021041.&nbsp; What the
                  program actually creates is a KiCad library containing
                  all parts of the multipart symbol, in all variations
                  of ordering of input pins (including missing pins,
                  which are tied to the power-supply return).&nbsp; The
                  only configuration omitted is that of no input pins —
                  i.e., of all input pins being tied to ground.&nbsp;
                  (An oversight on my part.)&nbsp; The library itself
                  should simply be retained permanently <a

                  script's command line.&nbsp; The functioning of the
                  script is quite simple:&nbsp; It uses sed to
                  stylistically correct dashed lines (whose unalterable
                  pitch in KiCad is not consistent with the large
                  physical dimensions of G&amp;N sheets), and then uses

              code itself is here</a>.<br>
          </p>
          <p>In creating a CAD transcription of a G&amp;N "logic-flow"
            diagram, manual choice of the appropriate connector and
            NOR-gate library symbols within the KiCad schematic editor
            (which is called "eeschema") can be quite cumbersome and
            time-consuming.&nbsp; The autoplaceKiCad.py program greatly
            eases and speeds up this process, in my opinion.&nbsp; As
            input, the user provides a text file that:<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Roughly divides the physical area of the schematic
              diagram into rectangular blocks.</li>
            <li> For each block, provides a <i>textual</i> description
              of the connector pads and NOR gates in that block.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The program then does a sanity check to expose duplicated
            pins or gates, or to find various inconsistencies in pin
            numbering, inconsistencies in the way individual NOR gates
            must be combined into dual-NOR gates, etc.&nbsp; If those
            checks pass, it outputs a KiCad schematic containing nothing
            except the specified components.&nbsp; That operation looks
            something like this:<br>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>autoplaceKiCad.py &lt;<i>INPUT</i>.autoplace &gt;<i>OUTPUT</i>.sch<br>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The user can then:<br>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Add the component data from <i>OUTPUT</i>.sch to his
              own schematic using a single cut-and-pasted operation with
              a <i>text editor</i> program.&nbsp; (Don't cut-and-paste
              within KiCad itself, or else it will "helpfully" reset all
              of the reference designators in the pasted block.) &nbsp;
              <i>OUTPUT</i>.sch is a complete, valid schematic, so you
              just cut from the first "$Comp" to the last
              "$EndComp".&nbsp; I usually paste just prior to the
              "$EndSCHEMATC" that appears at the very end the file.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Edit the now-combined schematic with the KiCad schematic
              editor, into the background of which the original scanned
              logic-flow diagram has been placed.</li>
            <li>Within the schematic editor, manually move each
              component where it belongs (relative to the background
              image).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This may <i>sound</i> like a cumbersome operation (and it
            is!), but experience shows pretty conclusively that it is
            actually quite a bit faster and far less error-prone than
            directly manually adding components within the KiCad
            editor.&nbsp; At least for me!<br>
          </p>
          <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>&nbsp; The workflow described above
            allows autoplacing a bit of the schematic at a time, rather
            than autoplacing all components in one pass.&nbsp; That
            temptation should be resisted.&nbsp; Sometimes that
            piecemeal approach is appropriate, but you have to be very
            careful.&nbsp; The thing you have to be sure of is that both
            parts of each dual-NOR are handled in the same autoplacement
            pass, because otherwise the program <i>will not </i>be
            able to be able to assign the same library symbol to the two
            parts.&nbsp; Piecemeal work also bypasses a lot of
            consistency checking as well, for things like duplicated
            parts.&nbsp; These problems will all be discovered later, of
            course, if KiCad's design-rule checker is run, but the
            inconsistencies will be a lot harder to fix manually in
            KiCad than they would have been in <i>INPUT.</i>autoplace.&nbsp;









































































            So it's safest to just have one big <i>INPUT</i>.autoplace
            file and to autoplace all of the components in one
            pass.&nbsp; You have been warned!<br>
          </p>
          <p>Before continuing, I should probably point out that the
            scanned image used for the background image in the schematic
            editor has to be prepared pretty carefully if you want it to
            be maximally useful.&nbsp; For one thing, if a sheet of the
            drawing was scanned in several frames, those frames must be
            recombined to produce a single unified image. The image must
            be scaled correctly; for example, if the original drawing is
            "E" size, then the scanned image must be scaled to be
            exactly 44"×34".&nbsp; Moreover, it should be
            rotated/stretched in such a way that vertical lines are
            vertical and horizontal lines are horizontal, and that the <i>inner</i>
            boundary of the drawing's border is 0.5" from the edges of
            the image.&nbsp; If the full-resolution scanned image is
            loaded into the schematic editor, it's probably going to be
            quite logy, or perhaps even unusable.&nbsp; So the PPI of
            the background image should probably be changed (whilst
            preserving the correct physical dimensions!) as low as you
            can stand.&nbsp; Typically, I use 50 PPI, but on some
            occasions have gone as low as 20 PPI.&nbsp; I won't trouble
            you with exact details how to perform each of these
            steps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than loading the background image
            scan into the schematic file, it is actually loaded into the
            KiCad "template" (*.wks) file for the design, using KiCad's
            worksheet editor program.&nbsp; (And <i>removed</i> from it
            prior to committing anything to GitHub, please since the
            template file will now be enormous!)<br>
          </p>
          <p>In its simplest form, <i>INPUT</i>.autoplace looks
            something like this:<br>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><tt>W= <i>width<br>
                </i>L <i>x y</i><br>
                J <i>pin1</i><br>
                J <i>pin2</i><br>
                J <i>pin3</i><br>
                ...<br>
                N <i>gate1 loc1 </i><i>a1 b1 c1</i><br>
                N <i>gate2 loc2 a2 b2 c2</i><br>
                ...<br>
              </tt></p>
          </blockquote>
          This defines a single rectangular block on the schematic, <tt><i>width</i></tt>
          inches wide, with an upper left-hand corner located <tt><i>x</i></tt><tt>,</tt><tt><i>y</i></tt>
          inches from the upper-left corner of the schematic.&nbsp; In <i>OUTPUT</i>.sch,











































































          the placed component will appear in rows starting at the top
          of this block and working downward as each row is filled
          up.&nbsp; In other words, it doesn't place the components
          exactly where they need to go, but just in the general
          vicinity.&nbsp; The <tt>J</tt> and <tt>N</tt> lines
          represent symbols to be placed on the schematic, and don't
          have to appear in the order shown.&nbsp; Plus, there are other
          kinds of symbols the program can add that I haven't put into
          the example.&nbsp; These symbol lines can be in any convenient
          order, though the most convenient order in terms of moving the
          symbols to their proper locations later are going to involved
          sweeping through the block row-wise, from left to right.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="sampleGates.png" width="335" height="282"
            align="right">Each <tt>J</tt> line represents a connector
          pin (an oval pad) with the associated pin number (<i>pin1</i>,
          <i>pin2</i>, or <i>pin3</i> in the example shown).&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Similarly, each <tt>N</tt> line represents half of a dual
          3-input NOR gate.&nbsp; The associated gate number (<i>gate1</i>
          or <i>gate2</i> in the example) is a 5-digit number written
          directly on the gate in G&amp;N logic-flow diagrams.&nbsp;
          Similarly, the location number (loc1 or loc2) is a 2-digit
          number written directly on the gate in the diagram.&nbsp; The
          gate numbers are all unique, and no specific gate number can
          recur.&nbsp; However, the location numbers relate to the chip
          rather than the gate, and since the chips are dual-NORs, each
          location number actually appears twice, with two different
          associated gate number.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Because these are triple-input NOR-gates, each has 3
          inputs.&nbsp; For the "A" half of the dual-NOR, the pins are
          labeled A, B, or C, while for the "B" half they are labeled D,
          E, or F. Thus the pin numbers ("<i>a1 b1 c1</i>" or "<i>a2 b2
            c2</i>" in the example) are "A B C" or "D E F" ... but not
          really!&nbsp; The original schematics were drawn very
          flexibly, so that the pins might actually be in other orders,
          such as "B A C" or "C B A".&nbsp; But more than that, the pins
          might be omitted completely in the drawing, with any missing
          pin implicitly being grounded.&nbsp; We represent missing pins
          as ";" or "_", so "<i>a1 b1 c1</i>" could actually be "_ A _"
          or "C B _".&nbsp; (When I created the symbol libraries and
          autoplaceKiCad.py, I neglected to consider that <i>all</i>
          the input pins might be grounded,&nbsp;"_ _ _", so I don't
          provide for that case.)<br>
          <br>
          In terms of actual numbers, therefore, our example <i>INPUT</i>.autoplace











































































          could perhaps be:<br>
          <blockquote><tt>W= 10</tt><br>
            <tt><i> </i>L 13.5 1.2</tt><br>

            <tt> ...</tt><br>
          </blockquote>
          But this just scratches the surface.&nbsp; In no particular
          order, here are some of the other variants that can be briefly
          described:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Blank lines or comments (prefixed with "#") are ignored.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Multiple "<tt>W=</tt>"/"<tt>L x y</tt>" blocks can
              appear in the file, thus tiling the sheet into rectangular
              blocks, of possibly differing sizes/shapes.<br>
            </li>
            <li><tt>J</tt> lines represent connector pads (visually,
              ovals wider than their height) with the wires exiting to
              the <i>right</i>.&nbsp; There are also <tt>j</tt> lines,
              also connector pads, in which the wires exit to the <i>left</i>.&nbsp;











































































              Similarly, the wires on <tt>K</tt> pads exit to the <i>bottom</i>
              and those of <tt>k</tt> pads to the <i>top</i>.</li>
            <li><tt>J</tt>, <tt>j</tt>, <tt>K</tt>, <tt>k</tt> lines
              can also have from 1 to 4 optional symbolic labels
              representing associated backplane signal names.&nbsp; For
              example, "<tt>j 153 F12B</tt>".</li>
            <li>Rather than an <tt>N</tt> line, you could use an <tt>X</tt>
              line ... which acts the same but specifies an "expander"
              NOR gate rather than a normal NOR gate.</li>
            <li><img alt="" src="sampleNodesArrow.png" width="332"
                height="178" align="right">There are also <tt>O</tt>
              lines ("oh", not "zero"), not shown in the example, of the
              form "<tt>O netname</tt>", such as "<tt>O DAS0/</tt>".&nbsp;











































































              These place a symbol having just one pin (exiting to the <i>right</i>)
              that looks like a small open circle with a label next to
              it.&nbsp; This is a common way to represent intrasheet
              connections in G&amp;N schematics.</li>
            <li>There are also <tt>A</tt> lines, not shown, of the form
              "<tt>A <i>digits</i></tt>", such as "<tt>A 1</tt>".&nbsp;
              These place a symbol that looks like an up-arrow with a
              number (<tt><i>digits</i></tt>) in parenthesis above
              it.&nbsp; It has no electrical function, but is used in
              some G&amp;N schematics to indicate how many other points
              in the schematic sheet are implicitly electrically
              connected to it, as opposed to being directly connected by
              a visual wire.&nbsp; Those other connections are the <tt>O</tt>
              lines mentioned above.&nbsp; Since the associated
              schematic symbols do not actually enforce any electrical
              connectivity between the two points, it is necessary to
              manually add matching KiCad netnames to the wires
              associated with the symbols for the <tt>O</tt> and <tt>A</tt>
              lines.&nbsp; That is done in the KiCad editor rather than
              in the <i>INPUT</i>.autoplace file. <br>
            </li>
            <li>If the 2nd field in a <tt>J</tt> or <tt>N</tt> line is
              ".", then the pad number, gate number, or location number
              simply autoincrements.&nbsp; Note that autoincrementing
              connector-pad numbers remain in the ranges <i>Nnn</i>
              where <i>nn</i> is 01-20, 22-50, or 52-71 (as would be
              required for Block II AGC logic modules).&nbsp;
              Incidentally, for Block II, the format of such an <tt>N</tt>
              line changes to "<tt>N . <i>n</i></tt>", where <tt><i>n</i></tt>
              is 1, 2, or 3, and is simply the number of input pins.</li>
            <li>In addition to <tt>N</tt> and <tt>X</tt> lines, it is
              also possible though rare to have otherwise-similar lines
              that instead begin with <tt>N1</tt>, <tt>N2</tt>, <tt>N3</tt>,
              <tt>N4</tt>, <tt>X1</tt>, <tt>X2</tt>, <tt>X3</tt>, or
              <tt>X4</tt>.&nbsp; This is discussed along with the
              general "<tt>N=</tt>" directive below.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Various options can be added to the autoplace file to modify
          this basic behavior.&nbsp; Each option appears on a line by
          itself, and they are typically grouped at the top of the file,
          prior to any of the "<tt>L x y</tt>" lines.&nbsp; Not all of
          these options have been designed to work in cooperation with
          each other.&nbsp; Here are the currently-available ones;
          they're shown in quotes for clarity, but the quotes aren't
          used in the actual input files:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>General:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>"<tt>G= <i>start</i></tt>".&nbsp; Changes the default
                starting point (0) for autoincrementing NOR-gate numbers
                in <tt>N</tt> lines to <i><tt>start</tt></i>.</li>
              <li>"<tt>P= <i>start</i></tt>".&nbsp; Sets the starting
                number for autoincrementing connector pads (defaults to
                1).</li>
              <li>"<tt>N= <i>symbol refd</i></tt>" (and <tt>N1=</tt>,
                <tt>N2=</tt>, <tt>N3=</tt>, <tt>N4=</tt>).&nbsp; Sets
                the schematic-symbol library name (<i><tt>symbol</tt></i>)
                and the reference designator prefix (<tt><i>refd</i></tt>)
                used when placing NOR-gates onto the schematic.&nbsp;
                The available NOR-gate symbol libraries are named
                D3NOR-*.lib, and any path or filename extension is
                omitted in <tt><i>symbol</i></tt>.&nbsp; The reference
                designator for any individual NOR-gate is automatically
                formed by prefixing <tt><i>refd</i></tt> to the gate's
                2-digit location code, and <tt><i>refd</i></tt> will be
                something like "U1", "U2", "U3", or "U4"; thus, the
                resulting reference designators will typically be of the
                form U + 3 digits.&nbsp; This scheme is based on the way
                the sheets of a typical G&amp;N logic-flow diagram are
                structured, in that <i>each</i> of the sheets will have
                2-digit location codes in the range 01-30, so that it is
                necessary to have unique prefixes for each sheet to make
                sure that reference designators are unique as
                well.&nbsp; Note, by the way, that an "<tt>N=</tt>"
                directive applies to the <i>entire</i> set of <tt>N</tt>
                lines in INPUT.autoplace, and not just to the ones that
                ones that follow it.&nbsp; Sometimes, though rarely, not
                all NOR-gates on a given sheet come from the same symbol
                library.&nbsp; Sometimes also, though even more rarely,
                a schematic will have a single sheet in which a
                combination of U1<i>nn</i>, U2<i>nn</i>, U3<i>nn</i>,
                and U4<i>nn</i> reference designators appear on the same
                schematic sheet.&nbsp; Neither of these latter two rare
                cases can be implemented using <tt>N</tt> and <tt>N=</tt>
                lines as just described.&nbsp; For those cases, <tt>N1</tt>,
                <tt>N2</tt>, <tt>N3</tt>, and <tt>N4</tt> lines are
                provided.&nbsp; They work exactly like <tt>N</tt>
                lines, but essentially provided non-overlapping
                "namespaces" — i.e., they allow the use of independent
                library symbols and reference-designator prefixes by
                means of their own directives "<tt>N1= <i>symbol refd</i></tt>",

                <li><tt>A52</tt>:&nbsp; J1 ("ConnectorA52").&nbsp; This
                  also has the side effect of changing the NOR-gate
                  pin-numbers to "2", "3", "4", "6", "7", "8" (and "_"
                  or ";").</li>
              </ul>
              <li>"<tt>full71</tt>".&nbsp; As mentioned above,&nbsp; the
                default connector type used in the absence of a "<tt>module=</tt>"
                directive, is appropriate for a Block II AGC logic
                module:&nbsp; 4 rows of 71 pins each, with the 21st and
                51st pins of each row removed.&nbsp; If <tt>full71</tt>
                is used, the missing 21st and 51st pins are restored to
                the default (by instead using library symbols
                "Connector-100", "Connector-200", "Connector-300", and
                "Connector-400").</li>
              <li>"<tt>GP= <i>prefix</i></tt>".&nbsp; As explained
                above, in each <tt>N</tt> or <tt>X</tt> line, the
                NOR-gate has a 5-digit "gate number" associated with
                it.&nbsp; If the leading digits are always the
                same&nbsp; — or indeed, if they are not all <i>digits</i>
                — then this directive can be used to specify what the
                leading characters are.&nbsp; It is then only necessary
                to enter the remaining digits within the <tt>N</tt> or
                <tt>X</tt> line, and the prefixed characters bypass the
                sanity check.&nbsp; For example, a gate number of
                "6_123" would be illegal if appearing directly in an <tt>N</tt>
                or <tt>X</tt> line, because it doesn't consist entirely
                of digits.&nbsp; However if "<tt>GP= 6_</tt>" were used,
                then just "123" would used as the gate number in the <tt>N</tt>
                or <tt>X</tt> line.&nbsp; The resulting gate number
                would still be "6_123", but the result would now be
                legal.&nbsp; To use this approach, however, <i>all</i>
                of the gate numbers would begin with "6_".</li>
              <li>"<tt>noloc</tt>".&nbsp; If this directive used, then
                the 2-digit location numbers are not visible on the NOR
                gates.&nbsp; They are still present, but simply marked
                internally as being invisible, and can be accessed or
                visually restored by editing the NOR gate within KiCad.<br>

                Indicates an official Block I drawing.&nbsp; In such
                circuits, the chips have one NOR-gate each (rather than
                two), and the input pins are "1", "3", "5" (and "_" or
                ";" if missing) rather than "A", "B", "C", "D", "E",
                "F".&nbsp; Moreover, there were two separate
                implementations of the circuits, referred to as AGC4 and
                AGC5, resulting in two separate NOR-gate gate codes and
                two separate pin numbers for each backplane-connector
                pad.&nbsp; The formats in <i>INPUT</i>.autoplace were
                altered accordingly:&nbsp; "<tt>N <i>loc gateAGC4
                    gateAGC5 pin1 pin2 pin3</i></tt>" and "<tt>J <i>pinAGC4










































































                    pinAGC5 signal</i></tt>".&nbsp; The AGC5 gate codes
                are the usual 5-digit numbers, but the AGC4 gate codes
                are like "1F4" or "2D3".</li>

                If present, connector pads (<tt>J</tt> lines) are
                automatically supplemented by an additional connector
                pad of identical appearance (but no electrical function)
                but having a dotted outline.&nbsp; Such pads are used in
                some Block I logic flow diagrams to indicate alternate
                backplane signals.</li>
              <li>"<tt>mirror1</tt>".&nbsp; Implies and depends on "<tt>shadow1</tt>"
                and "<tt>block1</tt>".&nbsp; Reverses the pin numbering

                This is used for schematics recovered from Block I
                descriptive document ND-1021041, which have various
                differences stylistically from the official
                drawings.&nbsp; Moreover, there are no 2-digit location
                numbers for NOR-gates in ND-1021041, so <tt>N</tt>
                lines become just "<tt>N <i>gate a b c</i></tt>".</li>
              <li>"<tt>bit</tt>".&nbsp; Uses 3-digit gate numbers rather
                than 5-digit ones, and automatically prefixes them with
                "xx".&nbsp; This is for schematics of a module that can
                be plugged into 16 different backplane slots, and in
                practice applies only to Block I logic modules
                A1-A16.&nbsp; If used, then <tt>J</tt> lines have 16
                backplane-signal labels rather than the limit of 4
                mentioned earlier.&nbsp; However, these labels are
                internal to the CAD and not displayed on the schematic.</li>
              <li>"<tt>dupej</tt>".&nbsp; Some Block I drawings have
                duplicate connector pads with identical pin
                numbers.&nbsp; This not allowed in KiCad, so normally it
                would be flagged as a fatal error by
                autoplaceKiCad.py.&nbsp; There are various non-fatal
                ways to handle such cases.&nbsp; One way is the "<tt>dupej</tt>"
                option.&nbsp; If used, whenever a duplicated <tt>J</tt>
                line is found, the 2nd instance an onward are replaced

          </p>
          <p>In transcribing Apollo G&amp;N electrical schematics to
            CAD, we want all component reference designators to match
            those used in the G&amp;N engineering drawings, and we
            particularly want reference designators appearing in
            netlists and electrical simulations to be accurate with
            respect to the original drawings.&nbsp; This is not a
            problem for most transcribed drawings but becomes a problem
            for some schematics of analog circuitry in which the circuit
            comprises hierarchical blocks which appear in multiple
            instances.&nbsp; For example, suppose the main circuit had a
            block (let's call it block "P") which is used 5 times.&nbsp;
            In KiCad, the natural way to deal with this is a process
            called "annotation", in which KiCad assigns distinct
            reference designators to each component appearing in each
            instance of block "P".&nbsp; Natural or not, the rules
            applied by KiCad do not correspond to the reference
            designators in the G&amp;N engineering drawings
            themselves.&nbsp; For example, if there were a resistor that
            we had called R3 in block "P", KiCad might annotate those 5
            instances of the resistor as R3, R101, R201, R301, and R401,
            whereas the G&amp;N drawings might refer to them as 1R3,
            2R3, 3R3, 4R3, and 5R3.&nbsp; The latter, of course, is what
            we <i>want</i>.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Working around this problem involves a semi-automated
            process with several steps:<br>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><img alt="" src="sampleBaseRefd.png" width="366"
                height="339" align="right">In the top-level drawing, the
              hierarchical blocks with multiple instances have to be
              given sheet names corresponding to the prefixes attached
              to the reference designators in them.&nbsp; <i>Usually</i>,
              these will be sheet names "1", "2", "3", and so on.&nbsp;
              In fact, blockAnnotater.py will strip any suffixed
              non-digit characters from the sheet names, as well as
              certain prefixes ("--", "xx", "XX") so sheet names like
              "1P" or "xx5Q" can be used just as easily as "1" or "5",
              if necessary to more-closely match the appearance of the
              original drawings.&nbsp; As for where these numerical
              prefixes come from, they cannot be deduced from the
              schematics, but instead have to be pulled from associated
              engineering drawings for the assembly containing the
              circuit, such as from <a

                visible, and assing its value as the reference
                designator as shown in the original engineering drawing.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Mark its actual reference-designator field as
                invisible.&nbsp; Or alternately, perhaps preferably in
                some ways, leave it visible but assign it a smaller font
                size and move it close to the visible location of the
                baseRefd field so that it is clearly subordinate to
                it.&nbsp; The image to the right illustrates the latter
                alternative; in it, markings like Q5 and R13 are the
                baseRefd field, whereas those like 1Q5 and 1R13 are the
                true reference designators.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Use KiCad's annotator tool to assign reference
              designators to the reusable circuit blocks.</li>
            <li>Exit KiCad and use blockAnnotater.py to reassign the
              reference designators which KiCad just assigned.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The actual reference designators assigned in the reusable
            blocks by blockAnnotator.py are <br>
          </p>
          <div align="center">(prefix derived from parent sheet name)
            concatenated to (child component baseRefd)<br>
          </div>
          <p>This is the appropriate formula in most cases, but there
            are a few cases in which the prefixes derived from the
            parent sheet name simply don't correspond to the
            chile-component prefixes in the engineering drawings.&nbsp;
            A numerical offset can be defined that changes the formula
            instead to<br>
          </p>
          <p align="center">(prefix derived from parent sheet name +
            numerical offset) concatenated to (child component baseRefd)</p>
          <p>(Notice that the "+" is meant to be a numerical
            addition.)&nbsp; The way this is done is by tweaking one of
            the 4 comment fields of the child schematic.&nbsp; If any of
            these comments is changed to<br>
          </p>
          <div align="center">NumberFrom=<i>N</i><br>
          </div>
          <p>then <i>N</i> is used as a numerical offset to the
            component prefixes within that child block.<br>
          </p>
          <p>At present, only two levels of drawings (parent + child)
            are supported, and this has proven sufficient for all
            G&amp;N schematics encountered so far.&nbsp; If any
            three-level drawings (parent + child + grandchild) are ever
            discovered, the software will need to be reworked.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Regarding the two different options listed above as to how
            to treat components' true reference-designator fields, both
            options have arguments in their favor.&nbsp; If the true
            reference designators are made invisible, the schematics
            (and in particular their PNG renderings) will look just like
            the original drawings.&nbsp; On the other hand, particularly
            in editing the CAD files, it obscures the fact that the
            markings shown are <i>not</i> the true reference
            designators, as well as obscuring the fact that the
            different instances of the block have different reference
            designators.&nbsp; The choice as to whether or not to
            display the true reference designators is therefore
            partially a question of personal aesthetics.<br>

          <h2><a name="Program:_eelint.awk"></a>Program:&nbsp;
            eelint.awk</h2>
          <p>In manually editing G&amp;N schematics in KiCad's schematic
            editor — and in particular, in adapting an existing CAD file
            for a different but similar version of the circuit — it's
            extremely easy to leave it littered with junky-looking
            constructs such as:<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Items not aligned to the 25-mil grid we use for G&amp;N
              drawings.</li>
            <li> Wires with a tiny inclination to exact horizontal or
              vertical.</li>
            <li>Wires with tiny jogs in them.</li>
            <li>Stray, short wires attached electrically at one end but
              dangling from the other, sometimes causing spurious
              junctions (fat dots) to appear.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The program eelint.awk analyzes a schematic to find such
            problems.&nbsp; In its simplest form, the program is run as
            follows:<br>
          </p>
          <div align="center">awk -f eelink.awk <i>INPUT</i>.sch <i>INPUT</i>.sch








































































            &gt;<i>OUTPUT</i>.sch<br>
            <div align="left"><br>
              Yes, the input schematic does appear twice on the command
              line, and it is not a typo.&nbsp; The script outputs error
              messages about the problems it has found to stderr, and
              outputs a completely new schematic file to <i>OUTPUT</i>.sch








































































              to stdout.&nbsp; The input file is not changed at
              all.&nbsp; If there are no error messages, then the output
              file should be the same as the original and can simply be
              ignored.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              However, if errors are found, then the output file will be
              like the original but with the addition of markers that
              have been inserted where the errors are thought to
              be.&nbsp; If <i>OUTPUT</i>.sch is edited in KiCad, you
              can simply do a text search for "eelint" (which is the
              name of the marker symbol that has been inserted).&nbsp;
              The idea is that you find all of these markers, manually
              edit away the problems, then remove the markers.&nbsp;
              Once you're satisfied, OUTPUT.sch can simply be "saved as"
              with the original file's name.&nbsp; Obviously, there's a
              danger here of overwriting the wrong thing, so care is
              required.<br>
